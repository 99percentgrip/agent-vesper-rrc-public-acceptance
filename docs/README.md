Choose a guide by what you want to do. Installation and everyday use come first; architecture, specifications, and historical evidence are separate below.

## For users

| Guide | Covers |
|---|---|
| [Installation](installation.md) | Supported systems, prerequisites, dependency setup, upgrades, paths, troubleshooting, and uninstalling. |
| [Using Vesper](using-vesper.md) | First tasks, settings, memory, reasoning, requirement verification, and useful commands. |
| [Skills and routing](skills.md) | Enable model-assisted selection, preserve your library, choose skills explicitly, and return to Standard routing. |
| [Zed integration](zed.md) | Connect the ACP server, select a provider, and keep editor chat history. |
| [OpenAI](openai-provider.md) | API-key and ChatGPT subscription authentication, model controls, usage, and account limits. |
| [Web tools](web-tools.md) | Enable fetching and browser interaction, repair the bundled driver, and understand supported operations. |

To try automatic skill selection, start with [Skills and routing](skills.md).
For installing the new version, follow [Update or choose a version](installation.md#update-or-choose-a-version).

For changes between versions, read the [release notes](https://github.com/99percentgrip/agent-vesper/releases). For a problem, [open an issue](https://github.com/99percentgrip/agent-vesper/issues) with your operating system, Vesper version, and steps to reproduce it. Remove credentials and private content from logs.

## For contributors

| Reference | Purpose |

| [Architecture decisions](adr/) | Accepted design decisions and their verification obligations. |

## Specifications and engineering evidence

These describe requirements, design decisions, and past implementation work. A specification or historical completion report is not a promise that every described feature is available in your installed version. Use the current status and release notes above.

Earlier migration records remain in [Stage 1](stage1/), [Stage 2](stage2/), [Stage 3](stage3/), [Stage 4](stage4/), and [Stage 5](stage5/). They are historical engineering references, not getting-started guides.
