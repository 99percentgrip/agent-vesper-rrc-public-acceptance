# Using Vesper

[Documentation](README.md) · [Installation](installation.md) · [Zed setup](zed.md)

## Start with a concrete task

Launch `agent-vesper-tui` from your project directory. After authentication, the
welcome screen shows your selected provider, model, and installed version. Use
↑/↓ and Enter, or click a row, to **Start coding**, open **Settings**, or **Check
for updates**. Settings uses a centered menu; select a category and then a value
with Enter. Applying a value keeps you in Settings. Esc goes back from values to
Settings, then to the welcome screen (or your conversation if opened while coding).
If you changed anything, choose **Save changes**, **Discard changes**, or **Keep editing**.
Check for updates contacts GitHub and offers **Install update** when a newer release
exists. Installation requires that confirmation; reopen Vesper afterward. Press R
for the release page or Esc to quit. Resuming with
`--resume <SESSION_ID>` goes directly to your conversation.

Ask Vesper to inspect the repository before making a change:

```text
Read the README and test configuration. Explain how this project is structured
and which tests cover authentication. Do not modify files yet.
```

Then give it a scoped implementation task:

```text
Add validation for empty project names. Follow the existing conventions,
add a regression test, and run the relevant tests. Report anything unverified.
```

The conversation shows tool activity and results. Review the plan for multi-step work, respond to permission prompts, and inspect the resulting diff. Automatic continuation is bounded; an interrupted or exhausted run can leave work unfinished.

## Settings and providers

The selected theme colors every native Settings panel, including Providers,
Swarm and Implementation acceptance. Theme changes preview while editing. Leaving
Settings with changes opens one save/discard prompt for model, reasoning,
auxiliary, generation, mixture, permissions, session mode, theme and feature
choices. Saved ordinary choices are restored on the next launch; model choices
are checked against the active provider. Provider setup keeps its explicit save.
Web tools still need a host restart, and importing a driver is a separate action.

Use `/settings` for provider selection and optional feature setup. Provider controls come from the selected adapter: model, reasoning, and account options can differ. Save changes explicitly and restart when the screen asks you to.

- **Z.ai:** authenticate with a key for your selected endpoint/plan.
- **OpenAI:** choose API-key or eligible ChatGPT subscription authentication. See [OpenAI setup](openai-provider.md).
- **LM Studio:** run its server, load a model, and configure the address and model through provider settings.

`/usage` reports the current model, reasoning, permissions, estimated context, and provider-reported account windows when available. Missing account information is shown as unavailable. Using a local harness does not make cloud-provider requests local; the selected provider receives the context needed for those requests.

## Voice in the terminal app

Voice is opt-in in **Settings → Voice**. Use **F5** (or the bottom-panel
**Push to talk** control) for dictation: press once to record and again to Stop.
The final transcript is added to the composer for review and is never submitted
automatically. Use **F9** for voice conversation after enabling it and saving
Settings: Stop completes capture, submits exactly one ordinary agent turn, and
speaks the reply through the selected local engine.

Current recognizers are final-only. Settings therefore labels **Live transcript
preview** as unsupported by the selected recognizer while also stating that the
final text appears after Stop. This describes the optional preview capability;
it does not mean recognition is unavailable. CPU recognition is the portable
local route. On supported AMD Linux systems, **Accelerated recognition (FLM
NPU) → Verify** checks the installed device, runtime and model through the real
local recognition composition before Automatic or NPU-required selection can
use it. Verification does not record, download, or send audio.

For speech output, the system voice remains available. The optional **Natural
Voice pack** adds local CPU Kokoro voices after its confirmed install and
verification flow. No NPU TTS route is advertised. While Vesper is speaking,
one F9 press stops the old speech and starts replacement capture; repeated
barge-in is supported. **Ctrl+C / Stop** cancels playback, synthesis and the
active runtime turn without starting capture, and a later F9 remains available.

Microphone audio and local synthesized speech stay on the machine. The selected
reasoning provider is separate: the final transcript and normal conversation
context are sent to that provider under its own privacy terms. Vesper v1 ships
no third-party cloud STT or TTS adapter, never silently falls back from local
speech to cloud, and does not advertise cloud speech. Such adapters are a future
optional feature behind explicit configuration, credentials, egress/privacy,
redaction and provider acceptance gates.

ACP editor sessions advertise no audio capability and do not expose microphone,
speaker, voice-status or Voice Settings controls. They retain the same generic
reasoning-provider runtime and cancellation semantics; audio stays a terminal
host capability and never appears as raw PCM or local status on ACP stdout.

## Useful commands

Type `/` to explore available commands or `/help` for the installed version's reference. Some terminal-only controls differ from editor controls.

| Command | Use it to |
|---|---|
| `/settings` | Configure providers and optional features. |
| `/usage` | Inspect model, context, and available account usage. |
| `/remember [--global\|--project] <text>` | Save a preference or project fact. |
| `/recall <query>` | Find relevant saved memories. |
| `/memories [query]` | Inspect memories and their IDs. |
| `/forget [--global\|--project] <id>` | Delete a saved memory. |
| `/promote <id>` / `/demote <id>` | Move a memory between project and global scope. |
| `/skills` | Browse available skills. |
| `/skill <name\|bundle:name> [task]` | Start an explicit skill workflow. |
| `/compact [focus]` | Summarize older working context with an optional focus. |
| `/acceptance start <PRD>` | Enroll a requirements document for completion verification. |
| `/acceptance status` | See remaining verification gaps. |
| `/mcp` / `/plugins` | Inspect and manage native MCP or signed-plugin integrations. |

Provider model and reasoning selections are best made through their native controls; available values depend on the adapter and your account.

## Memory you can inspect

Vesper separates project knowledge from global preferences. `/remember` chooses a scope and reports it; explicit flags let you choose:

```text
/remember --global I prefer concise explanations and conventional commits.
/remember --project Run npm test before changing the API handlers.
/recall test conventions
/memories
```

Use the displayed IDs to forget or move records. A move returns the destination ID. Project memory normally lives in `.agent-vesper/cognition`; global memory uses Vesper's platform data directory. [Installation paths and uninstall behavior](installation.md#install-locations) explain what to retain when moving machines or removing the app.

Recall can use semantic embeddings and keyword search. With no suitable embedding service, the local fallback relies on lexical similarity; do not expect the same semantic recall as a neural embedding model. `/embedding` shows the active configuration. Embedding configuration is independent of the chat provider when explicitly set, and changing the embedding model can require re-embedding stored memories.

## Verify work against requirements

For a feature with a written requirements document, turn on **Settings → Implementation acceptance**, then save when leaving Settings.
Vesper recognizes the task's PRD, checks its scope independently against your
request, and remembers its path automatically. You do not need to type a path
in Settings. In ACP, `/settings acceptance on` enables the same behavior. Or start one objective:

```text
/acceptance start docs/my-feature-prd.md
```

Vesper keeps the requirements separate from the agent's plan, reviews proposed checks, executes admitted Rust tests, and generates an evidence-based completion report. Missing, failing, stale, or inconclusive checks remain visible. An agent's claim that it is done does not itself satisfy the gate.

Use `/acceptance status` to inspect gaps and `/acceptance resume` to continue. `/acceptance revise <PRD>` changes scope explicitly while keeping prior scope in lineage. `/acceptance export <new-file>` saves an audit bundle; `/acceptance resume <audit-file>` restores scope with fresh verification. `/acceptance stop` stops enforcement without declaring success.

This applies to enrolled objectives. The initial collector runs exact Rust tests and needs a Rust toolchain and available dependencies. Independent review can miss semantic gaps; a verified report is scoped evidence, not a guarantee of defect-free software. [Design and verification boundaries](adr/0028-native-implementation-acceptance.md).

## Reasoning and workers

Reasoning orchestration can spend additional model calls on decomposition, alternative solutions, verification, or repair. To select a session mode:

```text
/reasoning set mode=balanced
```

Modes are `auto`, `fast`, `balanced`, `deep`, `maximum`, and `off`. `/reasoning clear` removes the override. These are Vesper workflow modes; `/thinking` controls the selected model's own reasoning options. More involved workflows can consume more time and provider allowance.

Multi-worker orchestration is opt-in through native Swarm settings and `/swarm` controls. It requires configured embeddings and an available permitted sandbox backend. The release includes the worker-capable binaries; enabling the feature does not grant tool or network permission. Use the settings/status controls to resolve missing prerequisites before starting work.

## Web and visual review

Enable web access through **Settings → Web tools** after installing Docker or Podman. Fetching, rendering, and browser interaction have separate choices. [Web setup](web-tools.md) covers the bundled driver and supported operations.

For local HTML work, VesperLens can open a browser review with annotations and feedback. You can request a review explicitly, for example: “Open this HTML page for review so I can mark changes.” Planning interviews can also collect structured answers. `/interview-limit` controls the number of planning questions. A local HTML review is separate from enabling internet browser tools.

## Skills and integrations

The installer seeds a shared skill library. Project skills can override shared skills with the same name. Upgrades add new seeds while preserving existing edits and recorded deletions.

For automatic selection from natural task descriptions, try **Settings → Skills →
Model-assisted selection** and save when leaving Settings. This optional preview
uses your configured provider and adds latency and usage. Standard remains the
default. See [Skills and routing](skills.md) for activation, explicit requests,
per-project controls, and fallback behavior.

Native MCP tools and signed declarative plugins extend workflows subject to permission checks. Configure MCP integrations in Vesper; do not assume editor-provided MCP servers are automatically executed by the harness. See `/mcp`, `/plugins`, and the installed command reference.

## Sessions and checkpoints

The terminal app supports saved-session resume with `agent-vesper-tui --resume <SESSION_ID>`. Editor chat persistence needs both session read and write flags; see [Zed setup](zed.md#keep-chat-history).

Checkpoints and lineage are a separate feature. In ACP they are off by default and require an explicit checkpoint root or `AGENT_VESPER_ENABLE_CHECKPOINTS=1`. Ordinary editor chats should not create a project checkpoint directory merely by connecting.
