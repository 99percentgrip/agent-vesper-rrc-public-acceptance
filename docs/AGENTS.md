# Documentation

## Purpose

Own durable project documentation and evidence-backed engineering records.

## Ownership

- `voice-control-prd.md` owns the requested persistent red microphone toggle,
  recorder state projection, responsive lifecycle and terminal acceptance.

- `Vesper bridge/` owns VB-PRD-001 (Vesper Bridge application-control
  subsystem): the frozen PRD, the Phase 0 reconnaissance evidence package
  with digest-pinned upstream sources, and later phase reports.

- `dependency-setup-prd.md` owns confirmed native runtime installation, reuse,
  managed-machine recovery, readiness checks and platform acceptance gates.
- `Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md` owns deterministic `/release`,
  CI recovery and post-release main-health requirements. Current implementation
  status, controlled GitHub receipts, five-target native host lifecycle
  evidence, and the required but unexecuted production publication remain
  in section 37 and the linked `foundation/` execution reports.

- `README.md` is the documentation landing page, separating user guides from
  contributor references, specifications, and historical evidence.
- `installation.md` owns user prerequisites, dependency setup, installation,
  updates, paths, troubleshooting, and the actual uninstall/data-removal behavior.
- `skills.md` owns user-facing skill routing activation, per-project controls,
  explicit invocation, data-flow/usage explanations and preview limitations.
- `using-vesper.md` owns everyday workflows and a curated command reference;
  `zed.md` owns custom ACP registration, provider selection and chat persistence.
- Keep user guides task-oriented and link to detailed engineering records rather
  than repeating implementation diaries or unverified capability claims.
- `recon/` owns the frozen Python-harness reconnaissance and Rust migration design.
- `foundation/` owns blocker-resolution evidence, compatibility decisions, fixture contracts, and disposable-spike verdicts.
- `vro19/` owns the adopted VRO-19 Google subscription/native-API planning bundle, its current G0 scope decision, retained source excerpts and unapproved delegated-agent architecture proposal. VRO-19 is on hold and reference-only: no further research, PRD revision, implementation, live acceptance or API-only substitute is authorized unless Alex explicitly resumes it.
- `architecture/` owns read-only external-repository pattern reconnaissance mapped to Vesper primitives for future features.
- Root PRD `advanced-hive-governance-prd.md` (VRO-16) owns the ratified requirements for task-level HITL gates (`YieldToHost`/`HostCommand`/`Suspended`), PIVOT/REFINE decision loops with judge separation, and deterministic verification gates; its upstreams are referenced exclusively as `governance alpha`/`governance beta` (naming-guard tokens land with its PR-1).
- `adr/` owns accepted production architecture decisions.
- `stage1/` owns production-workspace foundation evidence and readiness reports.
- `stage2/` owns shared-contract completion, compatibility, fixture coverage,
  and Stage 3 readiness evidence.
- `stage3/` owns the production GLM adapter evidence, compatibility, coverage,
  and Stage 4 readiness.
- `stage4/` owns the ACP adapter, minimal runtime, process-transcript evidence,
  coverage, and Stage 5 readiness.
- `stage5/` owns read-only session persistence contracts, discovery/runtime/
  replay evidence, disk invariance, governance, and Stage 6 readiness.
- Root documentation files own current architecture, workspace, dependency,
  security, contribution, migration status, and full-harness parity evidence.
- `openai-provider.md` owns native OpenAI Settings setup, authentication modes,
  model controls, account prerequisites, and explicit capability limitations.
- `vro18-native-xai-provider-prd.md` owns VRO-18 native xAI reasoning-provider
  requirements, phased acceptance, billing-path isolation, and adjacent-service
  exclusions. `architecture/recon_xai_native_provider.md` and
  `foundation/xai-provider-recon-execution.md` own its PR-0 evidence;
  `foundation/xai-provider-pr1-execution.md` through
  `foundation/xai-provider-pr7-execution.md` own phased implementation;
  `foundation/vro18-audit1-completeness-and-capability-truth.md` owns the
  independent post-v0.24.0 completeness/capability audit, F0 repair, invalid
  truncated-link correction, browser URL-integrity repair, live browser/device
  matrices and repaired Audit 1 acceptance boundary;
  `foundation/2026-09-26-v0.24.1-vro18-audit1-corrective-release.md` owns the
  exact-commit corrective release gates, publication/assets, Registry update,
  and explicit Audit 2/Audit 3-open boundary;
  `vro18-provider-authentication-settings-prd.md` owns the Settings
  authentication route, and `foundation/vro18.1-settings-authentication-execution.md`
  owns its implementation evidence;
  `foundation/xai-provider-pr8-live-acceptance.md` and
  `foundation/2026-09-25-v0.24.0-release-execution.md` own live and release
  acceptance. `xai-provider.md` is the bounded user guide.
- `web-tools.md` owns web-driver installation, immutable image identity,
  native Settings → Web tools and ACP `/web` activation, advanced opt-in
  configuration, operation bounds, and deployment troubleshooting.
- `skill-routing-quality-prd.md` owns the proposed descriptor/search/contract
  routing improvements and measured adoption gates. The primary goal is automatic
  selection of the correct skill from natural task descriptions, without requiring
  users to name skills. Preserve Alex's complete
  installed skill library: task shortlisting must not delete, automatically
  archive/disable or rewrite skill sources or user edits. It does not authorize
  full-body ranking or supersede ADR 0024 or the pending chunk-floor repair.
- `skill-routing-model-assistance-proposal.md` owns the approved bounded
  active-provider selection addition and its opt-in data-flow/latency boundary.
- `output-visual-upgrade-prd.md` owns semantic activity colors, truthful status
  dots, syntax-colored numbered diffs, and aligned responsive reports.
- `settings-and-update-prd.md` owns theme consistency, grouped Settings saves,
  automatic PRD enrollment and confirmed native update installation.
- Root PRD files (`*-prd.md`) own accepted phased requirement documents
  (e.g. `agent-vesper-reasoning-orchestrator-prd.md`,
  `provider-capability-gating-prd.md`, `qm-extraction-prd.md`,
  `result-aware-loop-detection-prd.md`,
  `web-oracle-extraction-prd.md`),
  and `swarm-oracle-extraction-prd.md` (VRO-15 — accepted requirements;
  its original completion claim is disputed by `foundation/vro15-gap-audit.md`,
  with full repairs approved and tracked in `foundation/vro15-repair-execution.md`;
  original decision record `docs/adr/0025-provider-neutral-swarm-orchestration.md`
  and superseding repair/parity decision
  `docs/adr/0026-swarm-repair-and-cross-host-acceptance.md`; upstream is
  referenced only as the swarm oracle — no upstream brand names may
  appear in docs or source, enforced by `cargo xtask naming-guard`);
  implementation evidence for their
  phases lands in the owning stage/foundation/adapter directories.
- `advanced-context-paging-prd.md` owns the planning-stage requirements for
  bounded skill chunks and rich per-chunk routing metadata. Its upstream is
  referenced exclusively as `context upstream` (same naming-embargo rule as
  the swarm oracle; recon evidence in `architecture/recon_context_paging.md`).
  Binding constraints: no document-ingestion/conversion surface (explicitly
  rejected), chunks land in `vesper-memory`/`vesper-agent` shared paths for
  both hosts, and `summary`/`key_elements` routing metadata stays default-off
  in automatic routing until the PRD's D3 repeated-benefit eval gate records
  an `ADOPT` verdict in `docs/foundation/` (recorded: ADOPT,
  `foundation/context-paging-pr4-eval.md`).
- `ranker-hardening-prd.md` owns the planning-stage requirements for
  eliminating the chunk-tier alias cross-talk (recon:
  `architecture/recon_alias_crosstalk.md`). Binding constraints: scope is
  Option A (raw stemmed chunk pools, alias loop bypassed for the chunk tier
  only) + Option D (failing cross-talk fixture as anchor) — global skill-tier
  routing arithmetic is explicitly out of scope; the bounded prompt-side
  residual (520-pt literal match) is a recorded, accepted limitation, not a
  hidden one.
- `voice-oracle-extraction-prd.md` owns VRO-17 — the planned real-time
  bidirectional voice subsystem extracted (no port) from the voice oracle
  upstream: `vesper-voice` as a provider-neutral, agent-free core with
  interchangeable local/cloud STT and TTS ports, barge-in routed through
  the existing transactional cancellation path, sentence-gated streaming
  TTS with pre-cloud secret redaction, and the PR-0…PR-5 gated migration.
  VRO-17 v1 ships the local speech stack; concrete third-party cloud STT/TTS
  are future optional features behind the existing ports and security gates.
  Its upstream is referenced exclusively as the voice oracle; reconnaissance
  evidence and upstream pin live in
  `architecture/recon_voice_oracle.md`.
- `chunk-score-floor-prd.md` owns the completed (2026-09-13) requirements
  for eliminating the chunk-tier cosine noise floor (finding:
  `foundation/exemplar-migration-execution.md` §5.1). Landed contract:
  the eligibility gate is the conjunction `(overlap >= 1 || name_match) &&
  score >= MIN_CHUNK_ROUTING_SCORE (520)` in `rank_chunks` only — a bare
  score floor was explicitly rejected (the observed 678-pt noise outlier
  passes 520; PRD §1.1); chunk-name admission is delimiter-bounded
  (`chunk_name_matches`); skill-tier thresholds (`AUTO_ACTIVATION_SCORE`)
  were never touched; the exemplar G5 test asserts the literal zero-chunks
  form on a verified vocabulary-free fixture.

## Local Contracts

- Separate confirmed current behavior from inference and proposed architecture.
- Cite repository-relative source paths, symbols, and line ranges when practical.
- Preserve unresolved contradictions and test gaps instead of smoothing them over.

## Work Guidance

- Keep reports independently useful and maintain the evidence index incrementally.

## Verification

- Check changed Markdown links and anchors, parse documented JSON, and compare
  install/uninstall commands against the scripts. Do not run a user's installer
  or uninstaller just to validate documentation examples.
- Review reconnaissance documents against `recon/AGENTS.md` and the mission completeness audit.

## Child DOX Index
