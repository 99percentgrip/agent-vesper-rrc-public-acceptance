# Contained web tools

Both TUI and ACP use the shared, default-off web service. Enable it only in
trusted workspace configuration. Network permission approval still applies;
configuration and tool discovery never grant approval.

## Activate from the app

In the TUI, open `/settings`, select **Web tools**, then use Up/Down and
Enter/Space to switch web access, fetching, JavaScript rendering, browser
interaction, and robots.txt handling on or off. `/web` and `/settings web`
also open this screen. The screen detects the installed driver automatically.
Starting with v0.22.5, choose **Set up features / repair** for confirmed runtime
preparation and contained browser checks; see [setup and platform status](installation.md#web-tools-and-container-workers).
Older builds retain **Set up / repair driver** for importing the bundled image. When entering through the main Settings menu,
go Back, leave Settings, and choose **Save changes** to save the whole draft.
**Discard changes** drops ordinary edits; it does not undo an explicitly confirmed
runtime installation or driver import.
The standalone `/web` and `/settings web` editor retains **Save settings**
(or S) and Esc cancellation. Restart the host to apply saved web choices.

ACP exposes the equivalent `/web status`, `/web detect`, `/web setup`, and
`/web <enabled|fetch|render|interact|robots> <on|off>` commands. For example,
`/web enabled on` enables the saved master switch. Configuration does not
grant permission for network tool calls. Private-address denial and sandbox
isolation stay enforced, not optional toggles.

The application saves a workspace `.agent-vesper/web-settings.json` snapshot
without modifying your TOML. That saved snapshot takes precedence over TOML;
the first save retains its existing allowlist, user agent, and output budget.
Docker or Podman is detected from PATH; `VESPER_DOCKER_BIN` remains an optional
operator override. Import-only `/web setup` starts no container; guided
`/web prepare` previews dependency setup and `/web prepare confirm` performs it,
including a contained readiness probe. Guided setup stores the verified engine
under the user home in `.agent-vesper/runtime.json`, separately from web toggles. No manual file editing or driver-asset search is needed.

## Install the driver

Packaging contract for v0.20.90 and later: drivers ship inside the application
archive. Older v0.20.89 archives used separate driver assets.

Complete application packages include the exact CI-tested driver image for
their architecture, its SHA-256 checksum, and immutable image ID under
`web-driver/`. Both installers automatically verify/import this image using
`agent-vesper-acp --setup-web-driver`. The standalone command is also available
for administrators; it needs no provider credentials and changes no workspace
settings. Setup checks the archive checksum before import, accepts Docker and
Podman ID formats, and verifies the imported image against the bundled ID.
An enabled web runtime uses that bundled ID unless an explicit image override
was configured; users do not need to copy a digest into settings.

In released builds, Docker or Podman must already be installed and running
(Linux containers on macOS/Windows). If the engine is unavailable during installation, the bundled
driver remains on disk: start the engine and use **Set up / repair driver**
in Settings. The UI shows progress and supports Esc cancellation. An import
already accepted by the engine may remain after cancellation; no web settings
are saved by cancelling. The installer preflight never installs a container engine;
guided setup requires its own confirmation.

The following separate-asset instructions are only for older packages and
advanced deployment with a different container-daemon architecture:

Releases that include driver assets publish an image archive for each Linux
architecture, including Docker Desktop on macOS/Windows. Select `linux-x86_64`
or `linux-aarch64` to match the container daemon, not its host OS. Download
the matching `vesper-web-driver-<architecture>.tar.gz`, `.tar.gz.sha256`, and
`.image-id` assets from the same release as the application.

Verify the archive with `sha256sum --check <archive>.sha256`, then load it
with `docker load --input <archive>.tar.gz`. Copy the complete `sha256:...`
value from `.image-id` into `web.driver.image`. This is the immutable image
configuration ID, not a registry manifest digest. A registry mirror may
instead use `repository@sha256:<manifest-digest>` after explicitly pulling it.
The application checks local image availability and never implicitly pulls.

Use a functioning Docker daemon; Podman's compatible CLI can be selected
with `VESPER_DOCKER_BIN=podman`. Release binaries enable the Docker backend.
Source builds must enable the host's `docker` feature. The Linux namespaces
backend currently has no configured egress interface; it is not a substitute
for the web driver. No unsandboxed fallback exists.

## Advanced manual workspace configuration

Merge into `.agent-vesper/config.toml`, replacing the explanatory image value
with the exact ID from the release asset:

```toml
[web]
enabled = true
respect_robots = true
user_agent = "agent-vesper"
output_budget_bytes = 98304
allowlist = ["https://example.com", "https://*.example.com:443"]
deny_private_addresses = true

[web.engine.fetch]
enabled = true
[web.engine.render]
enabled = true
[web.interact]
enabled = true
[web.driver]
image = "sha256:<64 lowercase hexadecimal characters from .image-id>"
[web.sandbox]
requirement = "network"
allow_network = true
```

Absent `[web]` registers nothing and performs no browser/daemon work at boot.
Fetch defaults on within an enabled scope; render and interaction default off
and require their own switches. Disabling private-address denial or choosing
an unpinned image is rejected. An empty allowlist permits public HTTP(S)
origins; it never permits private, loopback, or link-local destinations.
`AGENT_VESPER_SANDBOX=off` refuses web execution as well; it never enables an
uncontained fallback. Closing an unopened browser remains a no-op.

## Operations and bounds

- `web_fetch`: bounded raw page body, actual final URL/status internally.
- `web_scrape`: `markdown`, `fit`, `rawHtml`, `links`, plus page metadata and
  per-field density/truncation evidence. Query-aware fit uses BM25 fallback
  from page title, heading, metadata, then a substantial paragraph.
- `web_map`: page links plus robots-declared/default sitemaps, gzip decoding,
  recursive-index deduplication (25 documents, 10,000 URLs), optional ranking.
- `web_crawl`: breadth-first traversal, default 20 URLs/depth 2/concurrency 2;
  hard caps 200/10/4, wall-clock cap 120 seconds including the seed fetch,
  same-origin default, and explicit denial reasons.
- `web_interact`: `navigate`, `click`, `type` (optional `submit`, `clear_first`),
  `select_option`, `scroll`, `back`, `forward`, `reload`, `screenshot`, `close`.
  Actions use stable numbered live nodes, never model-supplied JavaScript.
  New numbers are marked `[new]`; removed numbers are never reassigned.

Fetch may escalate once to a separate ephemeral renderer on JS-shell signals;
policy refusals never escalate. The interactive page is not modified by a
scrape. Operations share four runtime permits; CDP actions have 45-second
deadlines, startup smoke has 30 seconds, and abandoned containers have a
900-second lease. Container startup waits at most 30 seconds and cleanup CLI
waits five seconds.
If a daemon stalls, its finite container lease remains the cleanup fallback.
Output defaults to 96 KiB per field, hard cap 512 KiB; the host's 1 MiB
envelope may impose an additional reported per-field cut.
Oversized screenshots fail explicitly instead of returning corrupt base64.

All DNS, TLS, robots checks, redirects and browser execution occur in the
resource-limited container. CDP uses anonymous pipes, not a debugging TCP
listener. Browser document requests pause for admission; v1 does not provide
a full subresource allowlist proxy. Sensitive form values are masked during
snapshot extraction. Web content remains untrusted, with provenance markers.
Pipe/protocol failure invalidates the session; actions are never replayed.

Missing daemon, image, helper, isolation, robots permission or browser smoke
produces a refusal. Bot walls fail honestly. PDF/OCR, stealth, downloads,
uploads, multi-tab orchestration and cross-run caching are not v1 features.
