# Persistent push-to-talk control

Status: implemented with automated Linux evidence; real-device/macOS acceptance remains open. Scope: native terminal voice input.

## Objective

Restore an obvious bottom-panel control for microphone dictation. Alex requests
one-click start/stop: a red circular symbol with “Push to talk”, changing to a
red square with “Stop” during capture. Keep F5 as the equivalent shortcut.

## Required behavior

1. Idle: show a red `● Push to talk` control in the normal coding footer.
   Clicking once or pressing F5 starts capture; holding the key is not required.
2. Recording: show `■ Stop` in red, driven by an actual live recorder process.
   Click/F5 stops capture and transcribes. Keep this distinct from agent-turn Stop.
3. Preparing and transcribing: show truthful named states, remain responsive,
   suppress duplicate starts, and provide bounded cancellation/cleanup.
4. Recorder exit, missing microphone/backend, permission denial and transcription
   failure must clear recording state and show an actionable message. No fabricated
   transcript or successful-recording indication based only on process spawn.
5. Preserve existing composer text and append the transcription without submitting
   it automatically. Do not place private audio/transcript contents in telemetry.
6. Reserve visible space for recording Stop across narrow widths, resizing and
   focus mode. Permission/menu overlays must not strand active capture; provide
   an unambiguous stop route. Drawing and mouse hit-testing share one projection.
7. Use terminal-native circle/square glyphs and semantic red with readable theme
   contrast. Terminal cells cannot promise a pixel-perfect circular GUI widget.
8. Preserve current supported recorder backends and report unsupported platforms
   honestly. ACP has no microphone terminal UI; no protocol control is invented.

9. Support long dictation until the user presses Stop; no arbitrary short capture
   cutoff. Display elapsed recording time. If disk/backend limits prevent further
   capture, stop truthfully and preserve recoverable work with an explicit message.
10. Transcribe longer audio incrementally or in bounded chunks with progress and
    cancellation. Do not apply the existing fixed 90-second whole-recording timeout.
    Bound stalled work without discarding completed chunks. Preserve session-local
    audio for explicit Retry/Discard after failures; disclose retention, keep it
    private, and clean up on discard/session exit. Never silently delete failed audio.

## Acceptance

- Real renderer frames at 40/80/120 columns and all themes: idle/recording/
  preparing/transcribing/error states, circle/square colors and exact click targets.
- Idle and active-agent footer tests explicitly require the voice affordance;
  tests of only already-visible chips cannot detect another omission.
- Controlled recorder/sidecar process tests: start, stop, early exit, duplicate
  input, delayed transcription, cancellation, shutdown and temporary WAV cleanup.
- Long dictation regression (at least 10 minutes of synthetic audio), slow but
  progressing transcription beyond 90 seconds, genuine stalled transcription,
  ordered chunk assembly without duplicated/lost text, retry/discard and disk failure.
- Actual terminal flow: click and F5, resize/focus/overlay behavior, composer
  preservation and no auto-send. Real microphone/OS permission acceptance must
  be separately recorded; no recording of Alex is part of recon.
