# Foundation Evidence Index

## Documentation CI and Windows readiness repair (2026-10-06)

- [Repair report](2026-10-06-documentation-ci-and-windows-readiness-repair.md)
  records the unnecessary documentation push, Windows readiness failures and
  cancelled matrix, same-commit documentation regulation, workflow exclusions
  and two-case red/thirteen-case green proof. Native Windows and corrected
  exact-main acceptance are pending; the published release is unchanged.

## RRC parity production release (2026-10-06)

- [Release execution report](2026-10-06-rrc-parity-production-release.md) owns the
  requested production integration and `0.24.5` release. Verification and publication
  are complete at mandatory RRC PRD scope: production `v0.24.5`, eight local gates, eleven prerequisites, seven producing jobs, sixteen verified assets, native `Complete`, and existing Registry PR #539 updated in place. The recurring Windows SSE fixture is corrected and proved on native Windows. [Current requirement trace](2026-10-06-rrc-parity-production-release-final-requirements.json) and the report’s final source/evidence/archive companions bind all 36 sections and 23 criteria to current evidence. Earlier failures and optional/live/platform limits remain explicit.

## Release Recovery Controller parity continuation (2026-10-05)

- [Completed continuation report](release-recovery-controller-parity-continuation.md) owns full requirement traceability and repairs. Source `bd24bb4` passed all nine local checks (83 selected/82 RRC, 69 exact, 11 command and 12 auth UI cases), ten isolated ACP repetitions, five native targets with direct named-case logs, controlled red/repeated-red/green probes, and all four main-push prerequisites with eleven successful jobs. Actual producing run 37346108219 passed all seven jobs; annotated test tag `v0.24.4` targets the exact source, all 16 assets were verified and native closeout reached `Complete`. All mandatory binding PRD gates passed. Production main/tags/Registry and Alex's installation remain unchanged.
- [Binding-section trace](release-recovery-controller-parity-continuation-requirements.json) maps all 36 sections and 23 acceptance criteria to current named cases and actual producing evidence; no mandatory gate remains pending.
- [Source manifest](release-recovery-controller-parity-continuation-source.json) and
  [receipt archive](release-recovery-controller-parity-continuation-receipts.tar.gz) bind
  exact runtime/workflow bytes, full native/main/publication logs, actual tag/assets,
  completed ledger, failed historical/tooling receipts and optional unexecuted checks.

## Release Recovery Controller deep debug (2026-10-05)

- [Earlier execution report](release-recovery-controller-deep-debug-execution.md)
  owns defect reproductions, implementation repair, exact source/verification
  receipts and PRD traceability. Its earlier incomplete verdict is historical; the continuation above now closes
  current producing acceptance. Live-provider/interactive checks
  remain optional unexecuted robustness evidence under binding PRD §§1–36.
  Current private controlled GitHub and five-target fixture checks passed;
  the OpenAI device-sign-in UI repair is included in later native candidates;
  real browser/account completion remains unexecuted.
- [Source manifest](release-recovery-controller-deep-debug-source.json) and
  [receipt archive](release-recovery-controller-deep-debug-receipts.tar.gz) preserve
  exact bytes, run identities, passed/failed/stale checks and acceptance limits.
- The older completion checkpoint below is historical and superseded by this audit.
## RRC PRD audit ownership repair (2026-10-04)

- Execution report: [`2026-10-04-rrc-prd-audit-ownership-repair.md`](2026-10-04-rrc-prd-audit-ownership-repair.md)
- Owning PRD: [`../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md`](../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md)
- Verdict: **DEAD CONTROLLER OWNERSHIP AND HIDDEN VERSION PREPARATION CORRECTED.
  NO RELEASE ACTION.** A dead or missing owner is `OwnerExited`, not `Active`.
  Version preparation and the resolved release version are persisted before
  `cargo check`. OpenAI startup does not contact unselected xAI discovery.
  Same-target historical reconciliation is unchanged.

## OpenAI TUI startup responsiveness (2026-10-04)

- Execution report: [`2026-10-04-openai-tui-startup-responsiveness.md`](2026-10-04-openai-tui-startup-responsiveness.md)
- Verdict: **OPENAI STARTUP NO LONGER BLOCKS TUI INPUT; FOCUSED PTY PROOF
  PASSED; NO RELEASE ACTION.** Credential lookup and account-model discovery
  run in the background. A stalled loopback `/models` fixture accepts typed
  and pasted input within 1.2s, then applies either the catalog or an HTTP 500
  without freezing later input. `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, default and
  `integration-test-harness` TUI Clippy, and `git diff --check` passed. No
  push, tag, publication, installation, broad verification, or VRO-19 work
  occurred.

## RRC explicit-version target repair (2026-10-03)

- Execution report: [`2026-10-03-rrc-explicit-version-target-repair.md`](2026-10-03-rrc-explicit-version-target-repair.md)
- Owning PRD: [`../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md`](../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md)
- Verdict: **TYPED EXACT-VERSION ADMISSION, EQUAL-TARGET NO-OP, AND SAME-TARGET
  CANDIDATE RECONCILIATION IMPLEMENTED; REQUESTED LOCAL GATES PASSED; NO RELEASE
  ACTION.** Natural release imperatives and `/release` accept stable `X.Y.Z` targets
  with optional input `v`, preserve bump behavior, and expose the requested target
  before mutation. An equal already-versioned target rewrites no version file and
  reuses clean canonical HEAD. Candidate push, CI, and failure receipts are archived
  historical evidence when the same target adopts a newer canonical strict
  descendant; a missing or mismatched release workspace cannot bypass that proof.
  Pushed target tags and actual publication still require clarification.
  Harness Clippy, focused/full harness tests, workspace tests, and all 50 acceptance
  cases passed. No push, tag, publication, installation, provider call,
  `cargo xtask verify`, or VRO-19 work occurred.

## RRC PTY stream-neutral test-oracle repair (2026-10-03)

- Execution report: [`2026-10-03-rrc-pty-stream-neutral-test-oracle-repair.md`](2026-10-03-rrc-pty-stream-neutral-test-oracle-repair.md)
- Owning PRD: [`../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md`](../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md)
- Test correction commit: `9a438ffc731e2bf1e70f53a06469bef0d790ad49`
- Verdict: **TEST-ONLY STREAM-NEUTRAL ORACLE REPAIR PASSED 10/10; FULL VERIFY
  NOT RUN.** The real-PTY fixture now terminates both independently drained
  streams with the same compact generic marker, so bounded-tail capture,
  confinement, and stale-settlement assertions no longer depend on stdout
  winning the scheduler race. Production telemetry capacity, capture, watchdog,
  release, and publication behavior are unchanged.

## RRC typed local-settlement acceptance repair (2026-10-02)

- Execution report: [`2026-10-02-rrc-typed-local-settlement-acceptance-repair.md`](2026-10-02-rrc-typed-local-settlement-acceptance-repair.md)
- Owning PRD: [`../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md`](../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md)
- Source commit: `25085a95a38f4df6ed6ec5ab41848e8c2be765b6`
- Verdict: **STALE ACCEPTANCE EXPECTATION CORRECTED; FOCUSED REGRESSIONS PASS;
  BROAD ACCEPTANCE NOT RERUN.** The lifecycle fixture deliberately cancelled its
  second real local gate, so `LocalVerification` with no source-failure evidence is
  correct. A separate focused regression proves a genuine local gate failure still
  enters `DiagnosingLocalFailure` with causal evidence.

## RRC liveness/watchdog repair (2026-10-02)

- Execution report: [`2026-10-02-rrc-liveness-watchdog-repair.md`](2026-10-02-rrc-liveness-watchdog-repair.md)
- Owning PRD: [`../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md`](../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md)
- Source base: `89dfb4eac5644c1738f55c8ea273a04dc6ac5e11`
- Verdict: **IMPLEMENTED WITH FOCUSED LOCAL REGRESSIONS; NO RELEASE OR BROAD
  VERIFICATION.** RRC local and repair work now use meaningful-progress inactivity
  without elapsed-runtime ceilings; individual GitHub/publication/health and remote
  Git operations remain bounded and cancellation-aware. Exact-SHA dispatch starts a
  fresh remote-watch window, and stopped-worker liveness persists into the shared
  TUI/ACP progress projection. The historical dirty RRC worktree and live `v0.24.5`
  epoch were not modified or reconciled.

## v0.24.5 deterministic governor repair (2026-10-02)

- Current execution report: [`2026-10-02-v0.24.5-rrc-deterministic-governor-repair.md`](2026-10-02-v0.24.5-rrc-deterministic-governor-repair.md)
- Owning PRD: [`../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md`](../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md)
- Fifth immutable failed candidate: `24ea5c99091b9fafe30efa1207b39273b8520612`
- Verdict: **FIFTH SOURCE REPAIR AND COMPLETE LOCAL GATES PASSED; A FRESH
  EXACT-SHA HOSTED MATRIX IS PENDING. NO TAG OR PUBLICATION IS IN SCOPE.** The
  complete `24ea5c99` matrix reduced canonical, MSRV, Linux x86_64 and Linux
  ARM64 failures to one live-host-dependent ACP process family while Windows,
  both macOS jobs, supply-chain and contained web-driver passed. The repaired
  integration-only permissive policy now selects bounded deterministic capacity
  before live discovery; production/default admission remains live and
  fail-closed. A new red-first regression, ten consecutive ACP process runs,
  all 50 acceptance cases, canonical `cargo xtask verify`, and Rust 1.88
  `cargo xtask msrv` passed. A fresh exact-SHA matrix remains mandatory.

## v0.24.5 RRC autonomy and CI repair checkpoint (2026-10-01)

- Historical execution report: [`2026-10-01-v0.24.5-rrc-autonomy-and-ci-repair.md`](2026-10-01-v0.24.5-rrc-autonomy-and-ci-repair.md)
- Owning PRD: [`../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md`](../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md)
- Immutable failed candidates: `864ca49a98ae6ea4ab900295fe8508c0ac7bac1b`,
  `b0528abeab4a81306a9a7c23b97a46876ca957ba`,
  `6fb1547abfce204ef64cc9fc7a6d6c6274e6eb24`, and
  `d771255dedc5825e68a4a6c8a4638bb5be932fdc`
- Verdict: **SUPERSEDED CHECKPOINT.** Candidate `24ea5c99` reproduced the Linux
  governor failure and invalidated this report's fourth-repair diagnosis; the
  2026-10-02 continuation above owns current status. Missing/partial matrix watch,
  transactional multi-family reduction, the historical receipts, and the explicit
  no-tag/no-publication boundary remain valid evidence.

## RRC current-pressure defer and zram repair (2026-10-01)

- Execution report: [`2026-10-01-rrc-resource-defer-zram-repair.md`](2026-10-01-rrc-resource-defer-zram-repair.md)
- Owning PRD: [`../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md`](../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md)
- Implementation commit: `7760e5079538219e2b9c0dd7e8a75322b7d62444`
- Verdict: **SOURCE REPAIR, COMPLETE LOCAL GATES, AND FRESH LINUX TUI
  CANDIDATE PASSED; NO RELEASE OR INSTALLATION.** Current risk now combines
  effective host/cgroup memory, reserve plus gate headroom, owned-tree RSS,
  memory PSI, swap trend, and zram physical backing instead of rejecting stale
  logical zram occupancy. Typed `ResourceDeferred` watches passively with bounded
  backoff, preserves retry budget and pending-gate identity, and resumes after
  three safe observations while both TUI modes remain visibly deferred. Final
  `cargo xtask verify`, MSRV 1.88, architecture, dependency policy, RustSec and
  all 45 exact acceptance cases passed. The checksum-preserved Linux x86-64 TUI
  SHA-256 is `85feb7013dc67e0435c083cb0c9ea684db11385fbf358cf0a669a5d87da0bb70`,
  different from the rejected candidate. No RRC epoch, push, tag, publication,
  Registry update, installation, swap/service/cache intervention or VRO-19 work
  occurred.

## RRC active-epoch final-integration repair (2026-10-01)

- Execution report: [`2026-10-01-rrc-active-epoch-integration-repair.md`](2026-10-01-rrc-active-epoch-integration-repair.md)
- Final audit: [`2026-10-01-rrc-active-epoch-final-audit.md`](2026-10-01-rrc-active-epoch-final-audit.md)
- Owning PRD: [`../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md`](../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md)
- Verdict: **SOURCE-COMPLETE, AUDITED AND LOCALLY VERIFIED; NO RELEASE ACTION.**
  The canonical corrected integration explicitly supersedes the live historical
  local-only prerelease epoch without redundant clarification, while preserving
  the complete old record and dirty primary checkout. The final red-first audit
  corrected current-objective clarification to show the known `0.24.4 -> 0.24.5`
  transition and made lifecycle acceptance independent of ambient workstation
  pressure without weakening production governor tests. All 45 exact acceptance
  cases and complete repository verification passed. Later build-only
  continuations preserved that evidence boundary: one governed locked workspace
  build passed, followed by one governed release-profile Linux TUI from exact
  product source `f7de8685` with the production candidate feature set. The final
  `0.24.4` binary is checksum-preserved outside `target/` for Alex-operated real
  release acceptance. No RRC epoch, version mutation, push, tag, publication or
  installation occurred. Any irreversible remote evidence still requires the
  controller's bounded clarification rules.

## RRC provenance ambiguity repair and corrected candidate (2026-10-01)

- Execution report: [`2026-10-01-rrc-provenance-ambiguity-repair.md`](2026-10-01-rrc-provenance-ambiguity-repair.md)
- Owning PRD: [`../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md`](../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md)
- Verdict: **CANONICAL SOURCE RESOLUTION, GOVERNED COMPLETE VERIFY, EXPLICIT
  44-CASE ACCEPTANCE, REAL RETAINED-WORKTREE PROBE, AND FRESH `0.24.4` RELEASE
  TUI PASSED.** Historical worktrees remain registered without forcing manual
  selection. The rejected `3.3.1` commit remains outside ancestry, and RRC retains
  exclusive ownership of the future `0.24.4 -> 0.24.5` release after Alex's authorization.

## Corrected v0.24.4 release preparation (2026-10-01)

- Execution report: [`2026-10-01-corrected-v0.24.4-release-preparation.md`](2026-10-01-corrected-v0.24.4-release-preparation.md)
- Owning PRD: [`../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md`](../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md)
- Verdict: **HISTORICAL CORRECTED 0.24.4 CANDIDATE; SUPERSEDED FOR MANUAL
  ACCEPTANCE BY THE PROVENANCE-FIXED CANDIDATE ABOVE.** Its source reconstruction
  and receipts remain valid for the recorded SHA.

## Restored historical tool-output stall record

- Historical incident and recovery record: [`2026-09-21-tool-output-stall-bug-and-recovery.md`](2026-09-21-tool-output-stall-bug-and-recovery.md)
- Current status: **CLOSED — RELEASED IN v0.23.6.** The restored index route points
  to the current report, which preserves the original incidents and acceptance box
  while linking the later permanent repair, five-target verification, and release.
  Stale OPEN wording and links to absent planning records from the older restoration
  branch were intentionally not reintroduced.

## Red main CI follow-up repair (2026-09-29)

- Execution: [`2026-09-29-red-main-ci-repair.md`](2026-09-29-red-main-ci-repair.md)
- Predecessor: [`2026-09-29-post-release-quality-check-investigation.md`](2026-09-29-post-release-quality-check-investigation.md)
- Verdict: **ROOT-CAUSE CORRECTION IMPLEMENTED AND LOCALLY VERIFIED;
  EXACT-COMMIT GITHUB GATES PENDING.** The first two pushed cleanup repairs
  (`af662ea`, `d097bdf`) both failed ordinary successful-command settlement on
  Apple Silicon and Intel macOS. Pinned XNU source proves why: a found process
  group containing only excluded `SZOMB` members produces POSIX `EPERM`, not
  `ESRCH`. The final correction classifies that Darwin terminal state, still
  requires leader reaping plus both pipe EOFs, and stops before an unnecessary
  final signal. The late-fork and LM Studio fixture repairs remain intact.

## OpenAI Responses live prerelease candidate (2026-09-30)

- Execution report: [`2026-09-30-openai-responses-live-prerelease-candidate.md`](2026-09-30-openai-responses-live-prerelease-candidate.md)
- Owning PRD: [`../openai-provider-prd.md`](../openai-provider-prd.md)
- Verdict: **NON-PUBLISHING LINUX DEBUG CANDIDATE PASSED OFFLINE AND ONE REAL
  OPENAI TURN; NO RELEASE OR INSTALLATION.** A clean isolated commit contains
  only the Responses boundary/error-surface repair over base `01d2df0`; the
  staged binary is hash-addressed and byte-identical to the dedicated build
  output. All 60 adapter tests and both TUI provider-failure tests passed,
  including a bearer-token canary absent from chat, Last Run and raw activity
  while a redacted placeholder remains in bounded activity diagnostics. The
  exact staged binary completed one OpenAI GPT-5.6 Terra turn and rendered
  `✓ Turn complete`. The unavailable historical event was not reproduced;
  cross-platform/release gates remain unexecuted.

## OpenAI Responses streaming boundary audit (2026-09-30)

- Execution report: [`2026-09-30-openai-responses-streaming-boundary-audit.md`](2026-09-30-openai-responses-streaming-boundary-audit.md)
- Owning PRD: [`../openai-provider-prd.md`](../openai-provider-prd.md)
- Verdict: **RECORDED FAILURE CLASSIFIED AS A BOUNDED JSON EVENT WITH AN
  UNSUPPORTED STRING EVENT TYPE; EXACT DISCRIMINANT AND LIVE REPLAY REMAIN
  UNAVAILABLE.** Direct loopback regressions cover one-byte and coalesced HTTP
  chunks, CRLF, multiline data, ignored SSE controls, unterminated EOF,
  aggregate traffic over 1 MiB, exact/over-bound events, canonical-JSON byte
  measurement and exact-once interruption with no tool replay. `MAX_EVENT`
  remains 1 MiB and unknown semantic events remain fail-closed. TUI/ACP user
  prose now uses only the bounded safe message while typed redacted diagnostics
  remain separate. Offline affected-crate tests, strict Clippy and architecture
  passed; no live provider, candidate, release, RRC or VRO-19 action occurred.

## OpenAI Responses decoder reinspection (2026-09-30)

- Execution report: [`2026-09-30-openai-responses-reinspection.md`](2026-09-30-openai-responses-reinspection.md)
- Owning PRD: [`../openai-provider-prd.md`](../openai-provider-prd.md)
- Verdict: **BOUNDED DIAGNOSTIC REPAIR IMPLEMENTED AND FOCUSED OFFLINE TESTS
  PASSED; NO LIVE PROVIDER OR RELEASE ACTION.** Pinned historical and current
  first-party source retain `response.metadata`, `codex.response.metadata` and
  `response.reasoning_text.delta`; Vesper already accepted those shapes and the
  focused loopback regression remains green. A red-first regression proved that
  true parser rejections still exposed only a generic safe message. The adapter
  now reports the decoder stage, allowlisted event type or `<unrecognized>`,
  rejected field, expected shape and applicable limit without rejected values or
  payloads, while retaining `MalformedProtocol` and fail-closed unknown events.

## RRC Linux live closeout and progress-contract audit (2026-09-30)

- Execution report: [`2026-09-30-rrc-linux-live-closeout-audit.md`](2026-09-30-rrc-linux-live-closeout-audit.md)
- Owning PRD: [`../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md`](../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md)
- Verdict: **LINUX HOST DECISION AND THE ONE REQUIRED PTY RUN PASSED; PROGRESS
  CONTRACT NOT READY; NO RELEASE ACTION.** The source-matched live observation
  selected two Cargo jobs and two Rust test threads on the 20-CPU host, retained
  the desktop memory/disk reserves, and did not create the managed target cache.
  The exact `rrc_terminal_pty` command passed once. Independent A–H review found
  unknown-denominator fallback and constrained-width status rendering proven,
  but found no overall/local/CI percentages and insufficient direct retry/reopen,
  durable-restart, and once-only conversation-projection acceptance evidence.
  The conditional release-readiness sentence was therefore not issued.

## RRC Host Resource Governor live Linux capacity observation (2026-09-30)

- Execution report: [`2026-09-30-rrc-governor-live-host-observation.md`](2026-09-30-rrc-governor-live-host-observation.md)
- Owning PRD: [`../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md`](../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md)
- Verdict: **READ-ONLY LINUX CAPACITY OBSERVATION COMPLETE; REQUESTED TUI TEST
  TARGET UNAVAILABLE; NO CANDIDATE OR RELEASE ACTION.** The timestamped
  source-matched `/proc`, cgroup-v2 and filesystem observation derived `Normal`
  pressure and the conservative two-Cargo-job/two-test-thread policy, with
  enough observed disk headroom. The absent controller-managed target cache was
  not created. Cargo rejected the specifically requested
  `rrc_governed_resource_recovery` TUI target before compilation; no test was
  substituted or written. This is neither expensive-gate admission nor
  cross-platform, worker-process, candidate, or release-readiness proof.

## RRC Host Resource Governor ACP process verification rerun (2026-09-30)

- Execution report: [`2026-09-30-rrc-governor-acp-process-verification-rerun.md`](2026-09-30-rrc-governor-acp-process-verification-rerun.md)
- Owning PRD: [`../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md`](../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md)
- Verdict: **LINUX-LOCAL ACP PROCESS PROOF RE-RUN PASSED; NO CANDIDATE OR
  RELEASE ACTION.** The exact controlled-Cargo ACP regression passed, as did
  strict format/lint/whitespace checks, the 44-case `cargo xtask acceptance`
  gate and complete `cargo xtask verify`. This confirms registered-worker
  RUN/resource status and governor policy inheritance for version `check`,
  locked `metadata` and the local gate without provider dispatch. It does not
  establish non-Linux resource support, Alex-operated live acceptance or release
  readiness.

## RRC Host Resource Governor ACP process acceptance (2026-09-30)

- Execution report: [`2026-09-30-rrc-governor-acp-process-acceptance.md`](2026-09-30-rrc-governor-acp-process-acceptance.md)
- Owning PRD: [`../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md`](../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md)
- Verdict: **LINUX-LOCAL ACP PROCESS PROOF PASSED; NO CANDIDATE OR RELEASE ACTION.**
  An actual ACP `/release patch` and `/release status` turn exercised the registered
  RRC worker, its live resource snapshot and a controlled local gate without any
  provider request. The controlled Cargo wrapper observed governor-bounded jobs/test
  threads and its managed target directory for version `check`, locked `metadata` and
  the local gate. `cargo xtask acceptance` passed 44 exact cases. This narrow proof
  does not establish non-Linux resource support, Alex-operated live acceptance or a
  release.

## RRC progress UX full-verification repair (2026-09-30)

- Execution report: [`2026-09-30-rrc-progress-ux-full-verification.md`](2026-09-30-rrc-progress-ux-full-verification.md)
- Owning PRD: [`../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md`](../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md)
- Verdict: **FULL REPOSITORY VERIFICATION PASSED LOCALLY ON LINUX; NO CANDIDATE
  OR RELEASE ACTION.** The first all-features real-PTY run exposed a narrow
  bounded-tail marker truncation defect. The fixture retained its real stdout/stderr,
  CSI/OSC/CR, confinement and settlement checks, but now uses compact paired labels
  that fit in the narrow RUN row. Twenty all-feature PTY repetitions and the full
  `cargo xtask verify` pipeline passed; the latter ended with all 43 enforced
  acceptance cases. Explicit container/device/public-web gates remain ignored by
  their existing contracts. Alex-operated acceptance, cross-platform resource/UX
  evidence and release gates remain unexecuted. No candidate build, release,
  publication, tag, push, installation, live-provider call or VRO-19 work occurred.

## RRC UX validation and deterministic repair (2026-09-30)

- Execution report: [`2026-09-30-rrc-ux-validation-repair.md`](2026-09-30-rrc-ux-validation-repair.md)
- Owning PRD: [`../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md`](../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md)
- Verdict: **LOCALLY VERIFIED ON LINUX; NO RELEASE ACTION.** Follow-up validation
  found and corrected four missing TUI milestone-cursor test initializers, a real
  cross-stream bounded-tail race in the PTY regression, and strict-Clippy failures
  in the current governor/progress source. The PTY still drives the real 120×36 TUI
  and rejects inherited stdout/stderr, raw controls, out-of-RUN writes, premature
  `Ready` and stale telemetry; paired terminal/CR terminus markers make its bounded
  tail assertion scheduler-order independent. Five consecutive PTY runs, strict TUI
  all-target Clippy, harness (183 passed; 2 ignored), TUI library (268), TUI binary
  (166), ACP library (61), and `cargo xtask acceptance` (43 exact cases) passed.
  Alex-operated live acceptance, cross-platform UX/resource evidence and production
  release gates remain unexecuted. No release, publication, tag, push, installation,
  candidate build, provider call or VRO-19 work occurred.

## RRC Host Resource Governor (2026-09-30)

- Execution report: [`2026-09-30-rrc-host-resource-governor.md`](2026-09-30-rrc-host-resource-governor.md)
- Owning PRD: [`../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md`](../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md)
- Verdict: **IMPLEMENTED AND LOCALLY VERIFIED ON LINUX; NO RELEASE ACTION.**
  RRC expensive local gates reconcile `/proc/meminfo` with the process cgroup,
  swap, owned-tree RSS/rustc count, target-cache filesystem, reserve/headroom
  policy and a cross-epoch exclusive lease before Cargo starts. They inherit
  bounded Cargo/test concurrency and controller-managed target storage. Critical
  pressure stops only the owned group and leaves `LocalVerification` resumable;
  TUI RUN and ACP status render the same observed telemetry. `cargo xtask
  acceptance` passed 41 exact cases, including cgroup, constrained-memory,
  constrained-disk, and resumable-defer cases. macOS and Windows resource
  discovery remain explicit unavailable/fail-closed extension work; this is not
  cross-platform governor acceptance. No release, publication, tag, push,
  installation, live-provider call, or VRO-19 work occurred.

- Verdict: **IMPLEMENTED AND SCOPED LOCALLY VERIFIED; NO RELEASE ACTION.** RRC
  persists a bounded typed phase, active gate, local/remote counts and monotonic
  milestones as a display/read-resume projection only. The executor's registered
  worker snapshot is shared by ACP status and TUI RUN; TUI conversation deduplicates
  updates by persisted epoch/sequence. Focused harness/TUI regressions and the ACP
  library suite (61 tests) passed. Full acceptance, full verification, ACP process-suite
  rerun, cross-platform CI and
  manual live-host acceptance remain unexecuted for this scoped UI/status change.
  No release, publication, tag, push, installation, candidate build, VRO-19 work or
  primary-checkout mutation occurred.

## RRC terminal-ownership corrective repair (2026-09-30)

- Execution report: [`2026-09-30-rrc-terminal-ownership-repair.md`](2026-09-30-rrc-terminal-ownership-repair.md)
- Owning PRD: [`../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md`](../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md)
- Verdict: **CORRECTIVE SOURCE REPAIR AND LOCAL PTY ACCEPTANCE PASSED; FRESH
  NON-PUBLISHING TUI BUILT; ALEX-OPERATED LIVE ACCEPTANCE NOT RUN.** Release child
  stdout/stderr now flow only through concurrently drained pipes, terminal-control
  sanitization, secret redaction, bounded registered-worker telemetry, one per-frame
  ViewModel snapshot and Ratatui. Interactive tracing no longer writes around the
  renderer. A real 120×36 PTY regression rejects raw CSI/OSC/CR/control output,
  out-of-RUN writes, premature Ready and stale post-settlement telemetry. Temporarily
  restoring inherited child streams made that regression fail with exit 101; restoring
  the repaired source made it pass. All 37 enforced acceptance cases passed. Replacement
  TUI SHA-256: `7e5cd4f3bc5dd0d3e15473b5f9cae0a202ad8f9fc5ad413b2053652c9351e0c1`.
  No release, publication, tag, push, installation or VRO-19 work occurred.

## RRC live telemetry UX repair and rejected prerelease TUI (2026-09-30)

- Historical report: [`2026-09-30-rrc-live-telemetry-ux-repair.md`](2026-09-30-rrc-live-telemetry-ux-repair.md)
- Corrective report: [`2026-09-30-rrc-terminal-ownership-repair.md`](2026-09-30-rrc-terminal-ownership-repair.md)
- Superseded verdict: **LIVE TERMINAL-OWNERSHIP ACCEPTANCE FAILED; CANDIDATE
  REJECTED AND MUST NOT BE REUSED.** Its unit/runtime telemetry evidence did not prove
  alternate-screen confinement. Raw release output corrupted the Ratatui layout and
  active compilation coexisted with `RUN / Ready`. The corrective report owns all
  current readiness claims and the replacement artifact.

## Live RRC task supervision (2026-09-30)

- Execution report: [`2026-09-30-live-rrc-task-supervision.md`](2026-09-30-live-rrc-task-supervision.md)
- Verdict: **ACTIVE AND PROGRESSING; NOT STUCK AT OBSERVATION TIME.** The exact
  fresh candidate owned `xtask verify` → `cargo test --workspace --all-features`
  → a live test executable. The leaf test changed from `voice_speech_pipeline` to
  `context_paging_composition` across an eight-second observation, while persisted
  RRC state truthfully reported `local_verification` / `workspace-verify: running`.
  No process was signalled and no live acceptance input was generated.

## RRC task-lifecycle prerelease candidate (2026-09-30)

- Build report: [`2026-09-30-rrc-task-lifecycle-prerelease-candidate.md`](2026-09-30-rrc-task-lifecycle-prerelease-candidate.md)
- Owning PRD: [`../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md`](../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md)
- Verdict: **FRESH RELEASE-PROFILE TUI/ACP CANDIDATES BUILT AND IDENTITY-VERIFIED;
  LIVE ACCEPTANCE NOT RUN; NO RELEASE PERFORMED.** The candidate source is bound to
  HEAD `01d2df045a7c30253bea8e613e9840b9f62d053b`, tracked-diff SHA-256
  `74b79361fdf24dccee6caee531dcc9228caea9764a175a0b63b6dab46ec5faed`, and
  status-inventory SHA-256
  `86589fb2dc69039d87fb2b2734804eba49510127e6e2e482862932d193f7476c`.

  `de49869ac53de856c6d1c9025c5a0eb3d881434196ec346a1713bc25d12ae67b`.
  The TUI differs from the rejected byte-identical candidate. No release, push,
  publication, tag, installation, live acceptance, or VRO-19 work occurred.

## RRC registered-task lifecycle repair (2026-09-30)

- Execution report: [`2026-09-30-rrc-task-lifecycle-repair.md`](2026-09-30-rrc-task-lifecycle-repair.md)
- Owning PRD: [`../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md`](../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md)
- Verdict: **IMPLEMENTED AND LOCALLY VERIFIED; LIVE TUI ACCEPTANCE NOT RUN; NO
  CANDIDATE BUILT; NO RELEASE PERFORMED.** Natural-language startup now returns
  only after one repository-keyed controller task is registered with retained
  thread ownership, cancellation and epoch/activity state. The real local-gate
  subprocess regression proves handler-return survival, persisted Running state,
  cancellation settlement and dirty-checkout preservation. TUI rendering derives
  running/TODO/Run activity from that registry and rejects simultaneous Ready or
  No active tasks labels. The previous byte-identical defective candidate is not
  reused as evidence.

## RRC stale-epoch autonomy repair and prerelease candidate (2026-09-30)

- Execution report: [`2026-09-30-rrc-stale-epoch-autonomy-repair.md`](2026-09-30-rrc-stale-epoch-autonomy-repair.md)
- Verdict: **LOCALLY VERIFIED; FRESH TUI CANDIDATE BUILT; LIVE ACCEPTANCE NOT
  RUN; NO RELEASE PERFORMED.** Natural-language admission now resumes a matching
  recoverable local epoch, archives and replaces an obsolete same-objective
  prerelease epoch, and preserves unrelated or irreversible release state behind
  one bounded human clarification. The acceptance gate passes all 34 exact cases.
  Candidate SHA-256 is
  `99de2f87e50abd696bac8b204539ec752f14ce9a41370ef8d44af7516c545f01`.

## RRC version-mutation prerelease candidate (2026-09-30)

- Build report: [`2026-09-30-rrc-version-mutation-prerelease-candidate.md`](2026-09-30-rrc-version-mutation-prerelease-candidate.md)
- Verdict: **FRESH TUI/ACP CANDIDATES BUILT AND IDENTITY-VERIFIED; MANUAL
  ACCEPTANCE NOT RUN; NO RELEASE PERFORMED.** The external candidate directory
  preserves release-profile Linux x86-64 binaries built from source HEAD
  `01d2df045a7c30253bea8e613e9840b9f62d053b` plus tracked-diff identity
  `f8360122e4cc1e77c7d744317e3e517cd2a204d41bc9d596dbafe9db19d74ec7`.

  No release, publication, tag, push, installation, manual acceptance, or
  VRO-19 work occurred.

## RRC complete version mutation repair (2026-09-30)

- Execution report: [`2026-09-30-rrc-complete-version-mutation-repair.md`](2026-09-30-rrc-complete-version-mutation-repair.md)
- Owning PRD: [`../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md`](../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md)
- Verdict: **IMPLEMENTED AND LOCALLY VERIFIED; NO RELEASE PERFORMED.** RRC version
  preparation now inventories all declared workspace members, rejects stale
  inherited package versions, internal exact path pins and Registry archive URLs
  before writing, applies one typed manifest/Registry transaction with rollback,
  regenerates `Cargo.lock`, and requires an all-target Cargo check plus locked
  metadata consistency before later release gates. The direct inventory covered
  118 exact internal pins across 27 manifests. Harness (162 passed, 2 ignored),
  all 30 acceptance cases, architecture, clippy, formatting and diff checks passed.
  Publication and fresh cross-platform execution remain unexecuted.

## RRC source-resolution UX repair (2026-09-30)

- Execution report: [`2026-09-30-rrc-source-resolution-ux-repair.md`](2026-09-30-rrc-source-resolution-ux-repair.md)
- Current objective binding: [`release-objective-provenance.json`](release-objective-provenance.json)
- Verdict: **IMPLEMENTED, LOCALLY VERIFIED, AND FRESH PRERELEASE TUI BUILT; NO
  RELEASE PERFORMED.** Release source selection now resolves committed completed-
  objective provenance before candidate trees, ignores unrelated historical
  worktrees, and limits clarification to genuinely different variants of that same
  objective using human labels rather than paths or SHAs. Harness (158 passed, 2
  ignored), ACP (61 passed), TUI (267 passed), and all 30 `cargo xtask acceptance`
  cases passed. Clean local completion commit `3f8ea52e7ee663498b401848444b689d07f09511`
  produced TUI SHA-256 `159a269bdc7d97d8569630097e327e5394089d4a76e351b8fe6cb84d353c7b97`.
  Manual acceptance, cross-platform CI, publication, push and installation remain
  unexecuted.

## Autonomous RRC prerelease candidate (2026-09-30)

- Build report: [`2026-09-30-autonomous-rrc-prerelease-candidate.md`](2026-09-30-autonomous-rrc-prerelease-candidate.md)
- Verdict: **CANDIDATE BUILT AND IDENTITY-VERIFIED; MANUAL ACCEPTANCE NOT RUN;
  NO RELEASE PERFORMED.** Fresh Linux x86-64 release-profile TUI and ACP
  binaries were built from the captured `rrc-autonomy-repair` working-tree
  snapshot into a new external Cargo target directory, then preserved under
  `/home/Alex/Projects/agent-vesper-prerelease-candidates/`. The report records
  artifact hashes/versions and exact HEAD, tracked-diff, and status-inventory
  identities. No version, tag, push, publication, installation, or manual
  release-intent acceptance occurred.

## Release-intent autonomy repair (2026-09-30)

- Execution report: [`2026-09-30-release-intent-autonomy-repair.md`](2026-09-30-release-intent-autonomy-repair.md)
- Verdict: **IMPLEMENTED AND LOCALLY VERIFIED; NO RELEASE PERFORMED.** Both production
  hosts now intercept conservative ordinary-language release imperatives before
  provider dispatch, resolve one clean completed source across repository worktrees,
  preserve a dirty active checkout, persist exact provenance, and launch the existing
  RRC from a clean detached release worktree. Ambiguity returns one specific
  clarification before any state/worktree mutation. Harness (158 passed, 2 ignored),
  ACP (61 passed), TUI (267 passed), the production publication-boundary test, and
  all 30 `cargo xtask acceptance` cases passed. No version, tag, publication, push,
  installation, credential, PRD, production `main`, or VRO-19 mutation occurred.
  Fresh cross-platform CI and live publication were intentionally not run.

## Release Recovery Controller final completion (2026-09-29)

- Final completion and full PRD audit: [`release-recovery-controller-final-completion.md`](release-recovery-controller-final-completion.md)
- Initial execution: [`release-recovery-controller-pr1-pr3-execution.md`](release-recovery-controller-pr1-pr3-execution.md)
- Hardening execution: [`release-recovery-controller-hardening-execution.md`](release-recovery-controller-hardening-execution.md)
- PR-4 through PR-7 continuation: [`release-recovery-controller-pr4-pr7-execution.md`](release-recovery-controller-pr4-pr7-execution.md)
- Owning PRD: [`../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md`](../Agent_Vesper_Release_Recovery_Controller_PRD.md)
- Historical verdict (superseded): **COMPLETE WITHIN THE AUTHORIZED NON-PUBLISHING SCOPE.** RRC-issued
- Verdict: **COMPLETE WITHIN THE AUTHORIZED NON-PUBLISHING SCOPE.** RRC-issued
  typed tokens gate version, commit, push, retry, tag and publication operations;
  deterministic source failures use a permission-aware AgentLoop in an isolated
  epoch worktree and require observed mutation/focused-proof receipts before
  fail-closed promotion and one fresh-SHA retry. The final audit found and repaired
  direct-child-only cancellation, with a regression-first leak canary. `cargo
  xtask acceptance` passes all 30 exact cases and `cargo xtask verify` passes.
  Four controlled GitHub scenarios remain preserved at exact fixture commit
  `e149b2e0f57ec9962ad56e217b1a5571b9fb1c23`. Native lifecycle run
  `36594339290` passed Linux x86_64, Linux ARM64, macOS Intel, macOS Apple
  Silicon and Windows x86_64 against exact candidate
  `60eacc5c8ef53f4dba1b4eed7d274fa26ec95284`, proving descendant reaping and
  fresh-process epoch/run/job reload. The private repository has zero tags and
  zero releases. Production publication remained explicitly prohibited and was
  not misreported as a pass; Agent Vesper `main`, tags, releases, registry and
  installations were unchanged.

## Separate agent process status check (2026-10-02)

- Read-only receipt: [`2026-10-02-agent-process-status-check.md`](2026-10-02-agent-process-status-check.md)
- Verdict: **TERMINATED ON EXPLICIT USER REQUEST; VERIFICATION INCOMPLETE.**
  The old TUI-session PID `7726` had begun a new `cargo xtask verify && cargo
  xtask msrv` sequence in isolated worktree `v0245-rrc-autonomy`; its observed
  tests progressed from `routing_quality_eval` to `vesper_provider_openai` and
  `hnsw_tests`. The user then directed termination. `SIGINT` stopped the exact
  TUI/xtask/cargo/test tree without escalation; PID `7726` and every process
  referencing that worktree were absent afterwards. The interrupted sequence is
  not passing verification, and no source/worktree content was modified by the
  supervising session.

## Active agent supervision (2026-09-29 08:45Z)

- Supervision receipt: [`2026-09-29-active-agent-supervision-0845z.md`](2026-09-29-active-agent-supervision-0845z.md)
- Related repair: [pushed repair report at `af662ea`](https://github.com/99percentgrip/agent-vesper/blob/af662eac572ba16763520c524dd131b1f9ddbe88/docs/foundation/2026-09-29-red-main-ci-repair.md)
- Verdict: **ACTIVE; NOT PROCESS-STUCK; TWO PUSHED REPAIRS REGRESS BOTH macOS
  TARGETS.** Commit `af662ea` failed successful large-output command settlement
  as `cleanup=uncertain` on Apple Silicon job `109324478181` and Intel job
  `109324478201`. Follow-up `d097bdf` changed the Darwin zombie proof but repeated
  the same ACP failure on Apple Silicon job `109343880064` and Intel job
  `109343880176`. The TUI was polling the remaining workflows despite the known
  reds. A root-cause correction or revert is required; no green/completion claim
  is valid.

## Post-release quality-check repair (2026-09-29)

- Investigation and repair: [`2026-09-29-post-release-quality-check-investigation.md`](2026-09-29-post-release-quality-check-investigation.md)
- Related release: [`2026-09-29-v0.24.4-combined-corrective-release.md`](2026-09-29-v0.24.4-combined-corrective-release.md)
- Verdict: **REPAIRED; FINAL CLOSEOUT CI GREEN ON ALL REQUIRED WORKFLOW
  FAMILIES.** Canonical run `36516876750` on documentation-only commit `7b04588`
  exposed an ambiguous relative marker target. Commits `ef84295` and `96cdb48`
  pin the side effect to the exact isolated-root path and encode the Windows
  PowerShell append script so the `cmd /C` argument contains no fragile quotes.
  Exactly-once evidence was not weakened with retries or sleeps. Final code
  commit `96cdb48` passed `pull-request-validation` run `36526811056`, MSRV run
  `36526811116`, web-driver run `36526811114`, and five-target Windows job
  `109271556643`; its overall matrix retained an unrelated macOS Intel MCP
  startup timeout. Documentation-closeout commit `78b459b` then passed
  pull-request validation `36530351592`, MSRV `36530351579`, web-driver
  `36530351551`, and all five jobs in foundation run `36530351536`.

## Combined corrective patch v0.24.4 (2026-09-29)

- Release execution: [`2026-09-29-v0.24.4-combined-corrective-release.md`](2026-09-29-v0.24.4-combined-corrective-release.md)
- Included repairs: shared skill-routing parser, native OpenAI Responses event
  compatibility, Z.ai MCP provider isolation/credential/diagnostic correction,
  and positively corroborated user-cancellation presentation.
- Current verdict: **RELEASED; EXACT-COMMIT GATES, FIVE TARGETS, ASSETS,
  AND ACP REGISTRY UPDATE VERIFIED.** Release commit
  `d22113528362706fa1672051dcb9385c82c22d8d`, annotated tag `v0.24.4`,
  all four prerequisite workflows, all five target jobs, release workflow
  `36515073932`, 16 published assets, every checksum, package contents, and the
  in-place PR #539 update are recorded in the execution report. Alex's
  skill-routing and cancellation acceptance both passed. Z.ai Search/Reader
  passed offline loopback acceptance; live Z.ai acceptance was not run because
  no active GLM Coding Plan is available.

## User-initiated cancellation presentation repair (2026-09-29)

- Execution: [`2026-09-29-user-cancellation-presentation-repair.md`](2026-09-29-user-cancellation-presentation-repair.md)
- Owning requirements: [`../output-visual-upgrade-prd.md`](../output-visual-upgrade-prd.md)
- Verdict: **IMPLEMENTED AND LOCALLY VERIFIED; RELEASE PAUSED.** TUI cancellation now requires agreement between the host-owned token and a cancellation-classified terminal, renders concise `Cancelled` semantics without rollback claims, preserves partial output/completed actions/diagnostics, and leaves failures/timeouts as failures. ACP retains its native cancelled stop reason under the same corroboration rule. A fresh uninstalled v0.24.3 TUI candidate is recorded in the execution report; no live provider request or release action occurred.

## Z.ai MCP provider-isolation finishing verification (2026-09-28)

- Final verification: [`2026-09-28-zai-mcp-web-tools-finishing.md`](2026-09-28-zai-mcp-web-tools-finishing.md)
- Initial repair: [`2026-09-28-zai-mcp-web-tools-repair.md`](2026-09-28-zai-mcp-web-tools-repair.md)
- Verdict: **RUNNABLE OFFLINE-VERIFIED CANDIDATES BUILT; RELEASE PAUSED; LIVE Z.AI ACCEPTANCE NOT RUN.** The exact dirty source passes the complete ACP process suite after explicit xAI credential isolation, fixed-category MCP diagnostics discard arbitrary upstream text, both Z.ai Search and Reader pass loopback positive paths, and non-Z.ai direct/discovery/stale/gateway routes stop before credentials or HTTP. Candidate hashes and remaining platform/live gaps are recorded in the final verification report.

## Z.ai MCP web-tools repair (2026-09-28)

- Execution: [`2026-09-28-zai-mcp-web-tools-repair.md`](2026-09-28-zai-mcp-web-tools-repair.md)
- Superseded process/diagnostic status: [`2026-09-28-zai-mcp-web-tools-finishing.md`](2026-09-28-zai-mcp-web-tools-finishing.md)
- Investigation: [`2026-09-28-zai-mcp-web-tools-reconnaissance.md`](2026-09-28-zai-mcp-web-tools-reconnaissance.md)
- Related requirements: [`../openai-provider-prd.md`](../openai-provider-prd.md),
  [`../vro18-native-xai-provider-prd.md`](../vro18-native-xai-provider-prd.md),
  and [`../web-oracle-extraction-prd.md`](../web-oracle-extraction-prd.md)
- Historical verdict at initial delivery: **IMPLEMENTED AND OFFLINE-VERIFIED; LIVE Z.AI ACCEPTANCE NOT RUN.** Protected definitions were scoped and the main offline checks passed, but three ACP disk-invariance vectors were then non-green. The finishing report supersedes that environmental diagnosis: the app-local `.config/` was invariant, an isolated child config lock identified xAI credential discovery, explicit signed-out test credentials resolved it, and the complete process suite now passes. No live provider call, installation, version, release, or VRO-19 action occurred.

## Z.ai MCP web-tools reconnaissance (2026-09-28)

- Investigation: [`2026-09-28-zai-mcp-web-tools-reconnaissance.md`](2026-09-28-zai-mcp-web-tools-reconnaissance.md)
- Related requirements: [`../openai-provider-prd.md`](../openai-provider-prd.md),
  [`../vro18-native-xai-provider-prd.md`](../vro18-native-xai-provider-prd.md),
  and [`../web-oracle-extraction-prd.md`](../web-oracle-extraction-prd.md)
- Verdict: **INVESTIGATION COMPLETE; REPAIR NOT IMPLEMENTED.** The current TUI-host failure is local pre-HTTP credential resolution: native Z.ai authentication is configured, but the MCP transport reads only process environment variables. Current Z.ai docs also expose a masked Search-name mismatch (`webSearchPrime` documented versus `web_search_prime` called), while Reader's `webReader` matches. HTTP status and JSON-RPC error codes are discarded, so the older truncated failure cannot be labeled `401`, `403`, `429`, entitlement, or quota failure. No authenticated MCP call, production edit, credential change, release, installation change, or VRO-19 work occurred.

## OpenAI Responses and shared skill-routing repair (2026-09-28)

- Execution: [`2026-09-28-openai-skill-routing-repair.md`](2026-09-28-openai-skill-routing-repair.md)
- OpenAI requirements: [`../openai-provider-prd.md`](../openai-provider-prd.md)
- Shared skill behavior: [`../skills.md`](../skills.md)
- Verdict: **IMPLEMENTED AND OFFLINE-VERIFIED; LIVE INCIDENT PAYLOAD AND PUBLIC-PROVIDER REPLAY NOT AVAILABLE.** Commit `560b32cdf9c209283c620aaf259790c8f61e8177` repairs bounded explicit-skill parsing and current subscription metadata/reasoning event decoding. Shared parser, native adapter, TUI PTY, ACP process, architecture and complete `cargo xtask verify` gates pass. The exact unretained historical provider event and full original paste remain unprovable; no live call, release, installation change or VRO-19 work occurred.

## VRO-19 hold decision (2026-09-28)

- Decision: [`vro19-hold-decision.md`](vro19-hold-decision.md)
- Retained reference material: [`../vro19/`](../vro19/)
- Status: **ON HOLD — REFERENCE ONLY.** Alex directed that VRO-19 receive no further research, PRD revisions, implementation or live acceptance. The existing documents remain available for reference, and an API-key-only Gemini provider is not an authorized substitute. Only Alex's explicit instruction may resume the initiative.

## VRO-19 adoption, G0 scope and architecture proposal (2026-09-28)

- Execution: [`vro19-adoption-g0-architecture-execution.md`](vro19-adoption-g0-architecture-execution.md)
- Adopted requirements: [`../vro19/VRO-19_Google_Gemini_Antigravity_Integration_PRD_v3.md`](../vro19/VRO-19_Google_Gemini_Antigravity_Integration_PRD_v3.md)
- G0 decision: [`../vro19/G0_SCOPE_DECISION.md`](../vro19/G0_SCOPE_DECISION.md)
- Architecture proposal: [`../vro19/proposed-delegated-agent-architecture.md`](../vro19/proposed-delegated-agent-architecture.md)
- Verdict: **DOCUMENTS ADOPTED; G0 FAIL FOR CONSUMER LOGIN; ARCHITECTURE PROPOSED, NOT ACCEPTED.** Current Google Terms and FAQ prohibit third-party software from using an Antigravity login and point third-party coding agents to separately billed API-key routes. Direct Vesper conversations, Vesper callbacks and VRO/worker/scheduler delegation are therefore disabled. No runtime, login, model, billing, implementation or release action occurred.

## VRO-19 revision 3 package/adoption review (2026-09-28)

- Review: [`vro19-prd-v3-package-review.md`](vro19-prd-v3-package-review.md)
- Package:
  `/home/Alex/Projects/prd/VRO-19_Revised_PRD_Package_v3`.
- Verdict: **PACKAGE VALID — READY FOR DOCUMENTATION/OFFLINE-SCOPE ADOPTION.**
  The documented validator and independent checks verified all 21 members, 20
  checksums, four companions, 23 local links, 26 source records, three retained
  excerpts, 74 account rows, 23 API rows, explicit row statuses/evidence and
  matching gate derivation. The five revision-2 findings are resolved; no new
  substantive contradiction was found. G0 and G1 remain `OPEN_EXTERNAL`, G2 and
  GG-15.8 remain `NOT_RUN`, and no adoption, runtime setup, login, model call,
  implementation or release occurred.

## VRO-19 revision 2 PRD review (2026-09-27)

- Review: [`vro19-prd-v2-review.md`](vro19-prd-v2-review.md)
- Input: external revision
  `/home/Alex/Downloads/VRO-19_Google_Gemini_Antigravity_Integration_PRD_v2.md`,
  SHA-256
  `2bb4358f9d413890a6c1442a23680fb26f6d8984107b57cd7c4028af160bdac6`.
- Verdict: **SUBSTANTIALLY CORRECTED — PACKAGE INCOMPLETE; REVISIONS REQUIRED
  BEFORE ADOPTION.** Revision 2 resolves the initial policy-order,
  delegated-architecture, authentication, permission, usage, platform, route-ID
  and trust-design findings. Its 73 atomic requirement rows are unique and cover
  GG-01…GG-15. Four asserted companion artifacts are absent, P2/G2 setup is
  circular under the current pre-G2 restriction, the required mutation proofs
  lack an atomic row, and per-row current status cannot be checked without the
  missing machine ledger. No Google login, runtime execution, provider-state
  change or implementation occurred.

## VRO-19 Google/Gemini/Antigravity PRD review (2026-09-27)

- Review: [`vro19-prd-review.md`](vro19-prd-review.md)
- Input: external draft
  `/home/Alex/Downloads/VRO-19_Google_Gemini_Antigravity_Integration_PRD.md`,
  SHA-256
  `c2a6517fd1fca2aadf80967025226f9ec28f826be2f9ec3a066e336fd65fb4fa`.
- Verdict: **REVISIONS REQUIRED — NOT READY FOR REPOSITORY ADOPTION OR
  PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION.** The account/API separation, billing isolation,
  runtime ownership, and bounded live-proof direction are sound. Blocking gaps
  remain in authoritative policy scope and delegated-agent architecture; high
  findings cover auth-flow assumptions, fail-closed permissions, contradictory
  `/usage` release criteria, six upstream targets versus five Vesper targets,
  and completion traceability. No Google login, runtime execution, model call,
  provider state change, or implementation occurred.

## Grok subscription usage release v0.24.3 (2026-09-27)

- Execution: [`xai-subscription-usage-execution.md`](xai-subscription-usage-execution.md)
- Release: [`2026-09-27-v0.24.3-subscription-usage-release.md`](2026-09-27-v0.24.3-subscription-usage-release.md)
- Verdict: **RELEASED.** Alex confirmed `/usage`. Release commit
  `32c511de0a436a51630de46e88fe6d4e81285aa2` is annotated tag `v0.24.3`.
  Paid API live acceptance was not run. Audit 2 and Audit 3 stay open.
  The installed app was not replaced.

## VRO-18.1 Settings authentication (2026-09-26)

- Requirements: [`../vro18-provider-authentication-settings-prd.md`](../vro18-provider-authentication-settings-prd.md)
- Execution: [`vro18.1-settings-authentication-execution.md`](vro18.1-settings-authentication-execution.md)
- Release: [`2026-09-27-v0.24.2-settings-authentication-release.md`](2026-09-27-v0.24.2-settings-authentication-release.md)
- Verdict: **IMPLEMENTED, USER ACCEPTANCE PENDING.** Settings → Providers can
  open a descriptor-driven Authentication panel for every registered provider
  without `/auth`. xAI and OpenAI can switch methods without deleting the other
  stored credential. LM Studio optional-key saves are real. Audit 2 and Audit 3
  were not run. No release tag and no installed-app change.

## VRO-18 Audit 1 corrective release v0.24.1 (2026-09-26)

- Execution: [`2026-09-26-v0.24.1-vro18-audit1-corrective-release.md`](2026-09-26-v0.24.1-vro18-audit1-corrective-release.md)
- Current verdict: **AUDIT 1 REPAIRS RELEASED.** Alex accepted the recorded
  browser/device, TUI/ACP, exactly-once tool, logout/reauthentication and billing
  isolation evidence. Release commit `2af108040e874fc87a5776df15f910687c7f81e8`
  passed canonical `36222063768`, MSRV `36222063783`, five-target `36222063763`
  and web-driver/native-host `36222063847` before annotated tag `v0.24.1`.
  Release run `36223955910` published 16 verified assets, and Registry PR #539
  was updated in place. Audit 2 and Audit 3 remain open. No local installation
  was changed.

## VRO-18 Major Audit 1 (2026-09-26)

- Execution: [`vro18-audit1-completeness-and-capability-truth.md`](vro18-audit1-completeness-and-capability-truth.md)
- Verdict: **REPAIRED — RELEASED IN v0.24.1.** The exact installed TUI is proven
  byte-identical to the published v0.24.0 Linux x86_64 artifact and reproduced
  the ordinary Grok-session rejection on the original state. The exact rejected
  component was stale API-key-only `attachment-search` without its required
  file reference. The repaired release-profile candidate passes live TUI and
  ACP `hello`; `read_file` and `run_command` each execute exactly once. Browser
  and device authentication independently pass issuance, user approval,
  Vesper-owned credential storage, post-auth turns, logout and browser
  reauthentication. The earlier copied-link failure is explicitly invalid: the
  terminal-wrapped URL was truncated before it reached the browser. Narrow-TUI
  action coverage proves open/copy preserve the complete structured URL. Audit
  1 repairs are accepted and released through the exact-commit receipts above.
  Codex and Vesper OpenAI remain separate PASS rows. Audit 2 and Audit 3 remain
  open future work.

## VRO-18 v0.24.0 release (2026-09-25)

- Execution: [`2026-09-25-v0.24.0-release-execution.md`](2026-09-25-v0.24.0-release-execution.md)
- Historical verdict: **RELEASED.** Exact commit `bd49ce69…` passed canonical
  `36148144754`, MSRV `36148144948`, five-target `36148144714` and web-driver
  `36148145047` before tag `v0.24.0`. Release run `36152583397` published 16
  assets; all seven checksum sidecars match server-computed archive digests,
  the Linux x86_64 package reports 0.24.0, and Registry PR #539 was updated in
  place at `de3d94f1…`. No local installation changed. Major Audit 1 later
  reproduced F0 in this exact release artifact; the entry records publication,
  not the current completeness verdict.

## VRO-18 PR-8 live SuperGrok acceptance (2026-09-25)

- Execution: [`xai-provider-pr8-live-acceptance.md`](xai-provider-pr8-live-acceptance.md)
- Verdict: live Grok-session discovery, text, shared `read_file`/`run_command`,
  continuation, bounded cancellation/recovery, image input, usage/status and
  logout pass. Live evidence repaired missing mandatory session-proxy headers,
  ACP's xAI image capability projection, auth-mode control intersection and
  credential-sensitive test isolation. Session hosted tools remain explicitly
  unsupported/fail-closed; separately billed API-key live acceptance was not
  run. Logout/device re-authentication and a post-login turn pass. The exact
  v0.24.0 release gates and publication subsequently passed.

## VRO-18 xAI host composition (2026-09-25)

- Execution: [`xai-provider-pr7-execution.md`](xai-provider-pr7-execution.md)
- Verdict: PR-7 PASS at offline scope. TUI/ACP registration, authentication
  projection, account model refresh, bounded controls for all six hosted tools,
  shared tool/voice/skill/VRO/memory/worker inheritance and safe citation
  rendering pass affected host/provider suites. Live acceptance and exact-commit
  release gates remain PR-8.

## VRO-18 PR-6 native compaction and WebSocket (2026-09-25)

- Execution: [`xai-provider-pr6-execution.md`](xai-provider-pr6-execution.md)
- Verdict: PR-6 PASS at offline transport and shared-policy scope. Explicit,
  default-off provider-native compaction atomically replaces only the older
  prefix, preserves opaque state, and records quality as unmeasured. xAI
  Global/API-key WebSocket shares HTTP semantics and never replays after
  dispatch; targeted AgentLoop and xAI suites pass. Host controls remain PR-7.

## VRO-18 PR-5 provider-hosted tools (2026-09-25)

- Execution: [`xai-provider-pr5-execution.md`](xai-provider-pr5-execution.md)
- Verdict: PR-5 PASS at offline adapter scope. New provider-neutral hosted-tool
  descriptors/selections keep xAI remote search, code, files, collections and
  Remote MCP separate from Vesper functions. Six applicable tools map only
  after explicit selection in verified Global/API-key mode; unsafe/unknown
  configuration and other auth/region intersections fail closed. Generated
  media stays excluded pending a generic media-output port. Host controls are
  PR-7; no live provider charge occurred.

## VRO-18 PR-4 tools, continuation, usage and citations (2026-09-25)

- Execution: [`xai-provider-pr4-execution.md`](xai-provider-pr4-execution.md)
- Verdict: PR-4 PASS at offline fixture scope. Shared function identities and
  tool results round-trip through the normal AgentLoop; explicit stored
  Responses continuation, bounded prompt-cache routing, opaque reasoning,
  normalized usage and structured citation retention pass 29 tests. The
  adapter remains unregistered; hosted tools, compaction/WebSocket, hosts,
  live acceptance and release remain open.

## VRO-18 PR-3 native Grok session authentication (2026-09-25)

- Execution: [`xai-provider-pr3-execution.md`](xai-provider-pr3-execution.md)
- Verdict: PR-3 PASS at offline loopback scope. Browser OIDC and device
  authorization, refresh/logout, locked Vesper storage, subscription proxy
  routing and strict session/API billing isolation pass 27 targeted tests. The
  adapter remains unregistered; no live provider request occurred.

## VRO-18 PR-2 catalog and capability intersection (2026-09-25)

- Execution: [`xai-provider-pr2-execution.md`](xai-provider-pr2-execution.md)
- Verdict: PR-2 PASS at offline fixture scope. Authenticated language-model
  discovery intersects eight explicit capability records; unknown and retired
  aliases remain non-executable; US endpoint, per-model reasoning, multi-agent
  semantics, image/tool gates and the strict JSON Schema subset are enforced.
  Targeted suite 20/20; hosts and live acceptance remain open.

## VRO-18 PR-1 native API-key Responses transport (2026-09-25)

- Execution: [`xai-provider-pr1-execution.md`](xai-provider-pr1-execution.md)
- Verdict: PR-1 PASS at offline fixture scope. The dedicated xAI crate owns
  API-key credentials, fixed Responses dispatch, strict tool serialization,
  bounded SSE decoding, cancellation, safe errors and opaque reasoning. Red
  strict-schema and oversized-event regressions are green (11/11). The adapter
  is not registered or advertised; PR-2 through PR-8 and live acceptance remain
  open.

## VRO-18 native xAI provider reconnaissance (2026-09-25)

- Requirements: [`../vro18-native-xai-provider-prd.md`](../vro18-native-xai-provider-prd.md)
- Architecture reconnaissance: [`../architecture/recon_xai_native_provider.md`](../architecture/recon_xai_native_provider.md)
- Execution report: [`xai-provider-recon-execution.md`](xai-provider-recon-execution.md)
- Baseline: `c64e78f46065f1fbaae899ab9914f3d9b3f7023d`
- First-party source pin: `xai-org/grok-build@f0e3be1100ef5252488e3be8bb0e91cf68d8c305`
- Verdict: PR-0 PASS. Public API-key work may begin. First-party session
  authentication/proxy evidence is sufficient to begin fixture-first PR-3 work,
  while feature availability remains auth-path/model/endpoint intersected and
  fail-closed. No production implementation or live provider call occurred.

- [Critical tool-output stall permanent repair](2026-09-24-critical-tool-output-stall-repair.md) — reproduces the shared `run_command` pipe-backpressure defect red-first, replaces exit-before-read capture with concurrent bounded draining and owned-tree cleanup, verifies TUI/ACP recovery and Linux descendant settlement, and records provider-surface/protocol parity. Its pre-CI OPEN checkpoint is superseded by the five-target closeout below.
- [Tool-output stall five-target platform verification](2026-09-25-tool-output-stall-platform-verification.md) — closes the Windows/macOS behavior gap at exact candidate `27a3f17b…`: all five native jobs and their dedicated nine-case settlement matrices pass in run `36036088105`. Windows fixture quoting/startup defects were repaired red→green. Provider correlation is **NOT EXECUTED — GLM live access unavailable**, retained as an explanatory limitation that does not block release of the classification-D repair.
- [v0.23.6 critical executor-stability release](2026-09-25-v0.23.6-release-execution.md) — **CLOSED — RELEASED:** exact commit `1da9834…` passed canonical `36065369597`, MSRV `36065369716`, five-target `36065369608` and web-driver `36065369575`; release run `36069150695` published 16 assets whose seven sidecars and all GitHub API digests verified. Continuous ACP Registry PR #539 was updated in place to v0.23.6. No local installation was changed.

- [VRO-17 PR-5 host parity and release execution](voice-pr5-host-release-execution.md) — final-phase owning record: ACP truthfully advertises `audio=false` and documents microphone/playback/status/Voice Settings/provider-control exclusions while retaining generic runtime/provider and cancellation parity. A release-feature defect was found: `release.yml` omitted Kokoro/FLM from TUI artifacts; the workflow now compiles the accepted local voice features while keeping model/runtime assets optional and unbundled. Cloud STT/TTS remain future optional adapters through `VoiceStt`/`VoiceTts`. Exact-commit gates, publication, assets/checksums and registry receipt are recorded here as they complete.
- [VRO-17 R6 device acceptance closeout](voice-r6-device-acceptance-closeout.md) — documentation-only closure from Alex's completed real-device matrix: baseline, one-press barge-in, old-speech stop/no-resume, exactly one replacement turn, repeated interruption, explicit Stop with no accidental capture, and later-F9 recovery all pass on the tested setup. Alex clarified that Ctrl+C stopping speech and its tested cancellation message are acceptable. The binding repair's production-entry evidence covers internal synthesis/runtime cancellation; the device run covers observable behavior. Short-reply candidate `f3b736f6…` is separately user-accepted as “Looks like smooth,” and pronunciation remains accepted. Corrected ledger: 17 PASS + 4 scoped + 1 optional/conformant = 22 rows covering R1–R20; PR-5 alone remains open and was not started.
- [VRO-17 short-reply quality and Voice Settings presentation repair](voice-short-reply-quality-repair.md) — traced the occasional short Kokoro pause through the real hygiene→worker path: prior cold/warm evidence ruled out player starvation, while the fixed two-sentence reply measured 0.972 s of stacked model edge padding. Short Kokoro units now retain bounded 50 ms artificial / 100 ms sentence guards (first onset, long units and system speech unchanged), reducing both installed voices to 0.200 s. An initially broad trim was rejected after it exposed 2.15–2.21 s long-form starvation; the narrowed policy restored the paced envelope and exact continuity PTY bytes. Voice Settings now says “Live transcript preview · not supported … (final text still appears after Stop)” instead of implying recognition is unavailable. Red→green tests, combined/default/Kokoro suites, strict Clippy, repository gates, exact-candidate F5/CPU-F9/FLM-NPU-F9 loops, and candidate `f3b736f6…` are recorded. Alex later accepted it as “Looks like smooth” on the tested setup; no numeric, universal or cross-platform acoustic claim. PR-5 was not started.
- [VRO-17 R6 production barge-in / Stop binding repair](voice-r6-binding-repair.md) — closes the §2.4 production binding blocker in source and controlled acceptance: one Speaking+F9 gesture routes directly through the existing genuine `BargeIn` transition (playback stop, synthesis-generation invalidation, one transactional runtime cancel, immediate replacement capture, one bounded interruption context); explicit Stop cancels voice output and runtime without capture; non-voice Ctrl+C remains generic. Red-first production-entry proof, interruption/F5/CPU-F9/FLM-NPU-F9/pronunciation/continuity/R20/R4/two-provider/TUI regressions, Clippy/fmt/architecture/naming/acceptance, and candidate `agent-vesper-tui-r6-binding-repair` (`1b82cc4167ff9333d9de961e078e79a38832b158efa16dbd88c452b257670225`) are recorded. Its implementation-unit verdict was device-acceptance pending; the later device closeout passed. PR-5 was not started.
- [VRO-17 NPU voice user-acceptance closeout — 2026-09-24](voice-npu-user-acceptance-closeout.md) — Documentation-only closeout for Alex's verbatim verdict, *"Cooooollll all working with npu and there is not gaps its sounds natural"*. The tested conversation is accepted for current use; perceived continuity and naturalness are user-confirmed on the tested setup. The future regression baseline is CPU Silero VAD + selected/verified FLM/NPU STT + separately configured reasoning provider + CPU Kokoro TTS. Exact tested executable remains unresolved: no acceptance is attached to `b289a6c1…`, `c4f29171…`, `fa0c3713…`, or the later-built `8895a711…` candidate. No measured-zero-gap, punctuation-pause, recognition-accuracy, interruption, universal, or full-NPU claim; full VRO-17/PR-5/release gates remain separate.
- [VRO-17 Kokoro cold-warm starvation investigation](voice-kokoro-cold-warm-starvation-investigation.md) — Alex's "early short reply pauses, later long speech smooth" observation measured with a fixed-text cold/warm matrix (2 voices × 2 texts × 3 runs, real-rate paced player double, real SpeechWorker→engine→bank→PlaybackOwner chain, plus CPU-load runs): **zero starvation events in every configuration** — the player never waits for data (EOF always beats audio duration by the 64 KiB pipe head). What IS cold: first-piece onset (engine build + ≈1.3 s first-inference warmup; onset RTF 1.24–1.38 cold vs 0.91 warm; steady-state RTF 0.78–0.93). Classification **NOT_REPRODUCED** as playback starvation — no Vesper-owned defect at bank/admission/player/scheduling; no repair applied (depth-2 bank + pipe proven sufficient in measurement). Pronunciation fix verified intact (4/4). Harness retained as `examples/cold_warm_starvation.rs`. Its R6-open statement is historical and superseded by the binding repair plus device PASS.
- [VRO-17 Kokoro pronunciation investigation and bounded repair](voice-kokoro-pronunciation-investigation.md) — Alex's three acoustic defects (reply→"ripple", ready→"read", now→"no") reproduced deterministically through the production phonemizer and root-caused to a **Vesper-owned espeak-ng invocation bug**: the joined text sections were sent to `--stdin` without a terminating newline, so espeak treated the final line as truncated and degraded the last word's pronunciation (diphthong flattening aʊ→oʊ, final-syllable elision ɛdi→iːd, final-consonant drops). Every corruption was final-word-of-piece positioned; mid-sentence words were always correct; segmentation/hygiene/token-mapping/resampling all exonerated by the boundary trace. One-line fix (terminating newline) with red→green proof — including an honestly recorded correction of a vacuous first red attempt (relative-path skip guard). All three words classified PHONEMIZER_ERROR. Candidate `agent-vesper-tui-pronunciation-repair` (3b1bb9d3…). The repair is subsequently user-accepted on the tested path, and no new pronunciation regression was reported in the latest smoothness retest.
- [VRO-17 R6 §2.4 contract reconciliation — historical PRE-ACCEPTANCE BLOCKER](voice-r6-device-interruption-acceptance.md#pre-acceptance-blocker--24-contract-reconciliation-2026-09-24) — the binding contract distinguished BargeIn from StopRequested and correctly found that the pre-repair Speaking+F9 path was speech-mute-only. This historical finding triggered `voice-r6-binding-repair.md`; it is superseded as current status by that repair and Alex's later device PASS. It remains indexed so the rejected two-press interpretation cannot recur.
- [VRO-17 R6 real-device interruption/recovery acceptance](voice-r6-device-interruption-acceptance.md) — **PASS on the tested setup.** A baseline, one-press and repeated barge-in, old-speech stop/no-resume, exactly one replacement turn, explicit Stop with no accidental capture, and later-F9 recovery passed. Alex clarified that Ctrl+C stopping speech and the tested cancellation message were correct. Historical pre-repair briefs and candidates remain in the record but are explicitly superseded. No every-platform/provider, numeric latency, interruption-note audibility or tool-replay claim.
- [VRO-17 R4 optional-partials amendment execution](voice-r4-optional-partials-execution.md) — closes R4 (2026-09-23, Alex-approved Option B): partials amended to an optional STT capability (final-only providers conformant; display-only/bounded/stale-safe/never-submitted when supported); capability table re-verified (all three production STT adapters final-only — no fake FLM partials); capability-aware Voice Settings (`voice_accel::partials_settings_row` + guarded toggle: "unavailable for the selected speech-recognition backend" on every current backend, preference preserved verbatim — red proof by reverting the production row fn); the specified two-fake-provider reasoning-neutrality regression implemented and green (typed + F9 origins × two providers through the same generic path — closing the audit's test gap); PartialGate retained as infrastructure (30/30 unchanged). Candidate `agent-vesper-tui-r4-optional-partials` (673f9fb8…); acceptance 23/23; F5/F9/FLM PTY PASS. Its R6-open statement was accurate at that unit's date; R6 later passed. PR-5 remains open.
- [VRO-17 R4 partials scope decision + provider-neutrality audit](voice-r4-partials-scope-decision.md) — historical decision-only record: it found all current adapters final-only, the generic provider path neutral, and specified the two-provider test gap while recommending Option B. Alex later approved Option B; the R4 amendment execution closed the capability and test gap. The older “awaiting Alex” status applies only to this record's date.
- [VRO-17 R20 default-build capture bounds repair](voice-r20-default-capture-repair.md) — closes R20 (2026-09-23): one managed store owns default F5 and feature F9 captures with the documented caps, reserve, lease recovery and cleanup; red→green default-build and PTY evidence is retained. Its older remaining-open list is historical: R4 and R6 later closed, leaving PR-5 only.
- [VRO-17 final completion audit](voice-vro17-final-completion-audit.md) — evidence-led R1–R20 matrix, phase-gate separation and user-evidence timeline. The 2026-09-24 closeout corrects the current accounting after R4, R20 and R6 closure: 17 PASS + 4 PASS with scoped limitations + 1 optional/conformant = 22 rows covering the 20 requirement IDs. All R1–R20 requirements are closed at approved scope. PR-5 remains the only open phase; the post-v0.23.3 voice tree is still uncommitted and has no exact-commit release evidence.
- [VRO-17 NPU voice — real-device user acceptance](voice-npu-user-acceptance.md) — Alex's 2026-09-23 verdict, verbatim: *"Cooooollll all working with npu and there is not gaps its sounds natural"* — positive real-device acceptance of the tested NPU-enabled conversation experience and perceived speech continuity/naturalness (perceived continuity, not a measured zero-gap claim; ordinary punctuation pauses not claimed removed). Supersedes the earlier "better but still has gaps" verdict as history. Exact tested artifact association **pending** (both live TUIs run an FLM-free installed binary; the exited 10:03/10:09 listening sessions have no launch receipt; root config rewritten at 10:08 is not an in-test record); no candidate basename/checksum is attached by default per Alex's explicit rejection. Composition scope stays as documented: CPU Silero VAD + FLM/NPU recognition (correlation-level placement) + CPU Kokoro synthesis; R16 not globally complete; quantitative latency/accuracy, interruption/cleanup cases, NPU TTS, MSRV/CI and PR-5 remain open.
- [VRO-17 R16 native Verify read failure — diagnosis and repair](voice-verify-read-failure-repair.md) — Alex's user-tested `owned ASR read failed or timed out` reproduced verbatim through the production Settings route; vendor log proof of the mechanism (orphaned owned-shape FLM servers exhaust NPU device contexts; a fresh server's model load fails `DRM_IOCTL_AMDXDNA_CREATE_HWCTX (EINVAL)`, the child dies, and the old read loop mislabeled the resulting reset as a read timeout — 0.879 s, no deadline involved). Repairs, both red→green in the owning `voice_flm.rs`: error-kind classification (`process exited while answering` vs `read timed out`) and a pure-std durable child registry + host-liveness-anchored reaper (dead-host orphan reaped, live-host child proven untouched, no unsafe, no timeout inflation). Candidate `agent-vesper-tui-verify-read-repair` sha256 b289a6c1…; native Verify + F9 PTY PASS against those exact bytes. R16 remains open (natural-speech accuracy, Alex's live-mic acceptance).
- [VRO-17 recording-review continuity boundary repair](voice-continuity-boundary-repair.md) — the 2026-09-23 silent-recording review directive: the zero-capacity handoff pinned the producer through the lane's drain so uncovered slow successor synthesis landed as boundary dead air (red at 1.019 s; depth-1 insufficiency derived, not assumed); smallest correction is the bounded depth-2 bank in the existing worker. Also repaired en route, both with red/green evidence: the FLM session's silent drop of `VESPER_PYTHON_PATH` precedence in the conversation-CPU adapter (caught only by the review-mandated legacy PTY loop; preserved older candidates PASS, the FLM candidate FAILS) and the scope-blind "using CPU" readiness conflation (now CPU-selected/available-not-selected/unavailable-refusal wording plus a real last-request route receipt). Test-isolation defects fixed: process-global chdir races (parity + flm_route roots, now parallel-stable) and verification-state order pollution. Candidate `agent-vesper-tui-continuity-boundary-repair` sha256 fa0c3713…; Alex's acoustic listening acceptance remains the open boundary.
- [VRO-17 NPU STT implementation gate — shared Silero VAD and FLM launch-gate correction](voice-npu-stt-implementation-progress.md) — persistent VAD protocol/regression on both silence and speech-positive paths (one speech-path defect found and fixed), explicitly authorized/hash-verified FLM Whisper asset, the initially failed launch receipts, and the 2026-09-22 corrected standalone experiment: FLM 1.0.5 `serve --asr 1` serves real NPU transcription on loopback (backend evidence; no production wiring yet; VAD preprocessor proven load-bearing because the backend hallucinates on unfiltered silence).
- [VRO-17 R16 production F9 routing repair](voice-npu-stt-implementation-progress.md#production-f9-routing-repair-2026-09-22-second-session) — the PTY round-trip exposed that F9's stop path ran the CPU sidecar while the FLM adapter was never given audio; fixed via the `voice.rs` conversation-STT slot, with three consecutive end-to-end passes (Settings save → Verify → F9 → FLM adapter → one agent turn → Kokoro PCM at a no-device sink; CPU recognizer poisoned and never imported) and all voice gates re-run.
[Voice pause audit — three culprits identified](voice-pause-audit.md): offline reproduction with the installed Kokoro pack shows ~400 ms leading/~770 ms trailing silence per synthesized piece stacking into 1.2 s gaps at piece boundaries, em-dash/hyphen punctuation tokens inserting model-level breaks ("Confirmed —" 380 ms vs 130 ms plain), and pre-speech compute latency as the third contributor. No code changes; fixes left for a scoped repair decision.
[Voice latency/performance repair after native acceptance](voice-latency-performance-repair.md): candidate uses a 28-character first/48-character successor policy after hygiene and one reusable worker per Natural Voice pack screen. The fixed long-unit fixture reached first PCM in 1.62–2.59 s across observed post-repair runs; release-mode ready-worker Preview attempts reached fixture PCM in 1.559/1.569 s. Focused tests and strict Clippy pass. Alex ran the release candidate and reported “ok its way faster then before.” The latency repair is implemented and qualitatively user-confirmed; repeat timings and the remaining full-phase gates stay open.
[Voice latency user acceptance — initial retest](voice-user-latency-acceptance.md): **NOT ACCEPTED / PHASE OPEN.** Alex observed approximately 20 s, 40 s and 20 s to first spoken output across three attempts and approximately 10–15 s for Preview; recording was described as fast (~2–3 s on the first attempt). A later locally verified candidate is linked above but has not received native user acceptance. These human observations override any phase-completion inference from narrow fixture benchmarks.
[First-speech repair and native NPU assessment](voice-first-speech-and-npu-assessment.md): code-level local repair only. One authorized live turn reached first PCM at 26.99 s before the repair; a subsequent local fixed-text benchmark measured 8.602 s whole-unit preparation versus 2.733 s first PCM, with one user-confirmed natural playback. The later native retest above failed latency acceptance. AMD NPU/FLM/XRT readiness is verified, but native STT and TTS offload gates remain separately open.
[Speech sentence-pipeline repair](voice-speech-pipeline-repair.md): one-unit lookahead removes the reproduced serial synthesis/drain gap; isolated Stop/FIFO regressions pass and Alex confirmed the overlapping check had no sentence delay. The initial live coding reply delay remains unresolved.
[Voice latency repair](voice-latency-repair.md): repeated pack checks reduced from about 1500 ms to below 0.11 ms; slow-import recorder regression and direct/VRO first-PCM timings recorded. No instant/live-provider latency claim.
[Kokoro PCM scaling repair](voice-kokoro-pcm-scaling-repair.md): missing float-to-s16 amplitude scaling reproduced and repaired; both real voices and direct/VRO signal gates pass; Alex confirmed one corrected playback clear and complete. Broader native acceptance remains open.
[Authorized Kokoro playback probe](voice-kokoro-authorized-playback.md): real worker and player drained the original approved sample, but Alex confirmed he did not hear it. The later PCM repair and separately approved corrected listening result are linked above.
[Voice playback diagnostics repair](voice-playback-diagnostics-repair.md): device-free red→green failure classification and stderr-pressure tests; the later PCM scaling report above identifies and repairs the silent-signal defect.
[Voice-oracle reconnaissance](../architecture/recon_voice_oracle.md): read-only, line-cited analysis of the pinned upstream (`88998de`, MIT) — STT failover with unavailable≠error, sentence-gated streaming TTS with pre-cloud secret redaction, barge-in that records the last heard sentence and prefixes the next turn, per-stage latency telemetry on every outcome; includes the VAD-policy conflict with our shipped evidence and the documented-but-unimplemented `ack` gap. Work-unit record: [voice-oracle-recon-execution](voice-oracle-recon-execution.md) (no implementation; directive-authorized source reading recorded as a deviation in `docs/architecture/AGENTS.md`). Feeds [VRO-17 — the voice-oracle extraction PRD](../voice-oracle-extraction-prd.md): `vesper-voice` provider-neutral core, interchangeable local/cloud STT/TTS ports, agent-free orchestration over the existing runtime cancellation path, and the PR-0…PR-5 gated migration plan.
[VRO-17 PR-0 execution](voice-oracle-pr0-execution.md): contract hardening (20 findings D1–D20, incl. the GPL-3.0 refutation of the "Piper (MIT)" dependency assumption and the NPU device-present/userland-absent record) and the `vesper-voice` pure core — 61 crate tests, workspace 2528/0, arch 29 pkgs, naming 36 frozen, acceptance 23/23; no adapters/capture/hosts touched; PR-1 ready against frozen contracts. Updated PRD: decision record §7 + traceability matrix §8.
[VRO-17 PR-1 execution](voice-oracle-pr1-execution.md): `stt-sidecar` (Rust adapter + shipped sidecar inference, warm child, process-group reaping, bounded IO, VAD binding), `stt-http` (validated endpoint, redirect refusal, truthful error matrix, D21 `LegacyEmptyResponse` provenance for legacy-worker empties), `FailoverStt` (frozen policy, per-attempt egress recheck, attempt bound), `PartialGate` (buffered-repass partials, whole-capture budget, final priority, stale rejection, no turn-submission surface), 30 adapter tests over subprocess/TCP fixtures; workspace 2569/0 all-features, arch 29, naming 36 frozen, acceptance 23/23, dictation suites untouched. Real-model probes (cached tiny/base, VAD on): silence 30/90 s and tone fixtures all empty — no hallucinations; **speech-fixture recognition receipt remains open**. Native-STT verdict: suitable-with-prerequisites, nothing implemented. PRD amended: D21/D22 + status/PR-1 sections.
[Existing voice-stack reconnaissance](../architecture/recon_existing_voice_stack.md): read-only trace of the shipped v0.23.3 push-to-talk path (F5 → arecord/afrecord → shipped sidecar, `vad_filter=True` → composer append, never auto-submit) and the auditable negative result for assistant speech output (bell-only; no TTS module/dep/call site in any build; PR-0/PR-1 unreferenced by hosts). Reuse-vs-gap matrix separates synthesis/playback/dispatch/hygiene/interruption/connection gaps; recommendation-only PR-2 correction: smallest task is a feature-gated subprocess TTS adapter over user-installed system speech binaries — **not reviewed by Alex yet; PR-2 remains paused**.
[VRO-17 PR-2 execution](voice-oracle-pr2-execution.md): hygiene/sentence gate (cross-chunk protected spans, redaction, bounded overflow, 16 tests) + synthesis-only `tts-subprocess` adapter (engine gate PASS as optional user-installed system-engine baseline — no bundling, zero new deps, `deny.toml` untouched; streaming-WAV validation ignoring placeholder sizes, 22050→16000 conversion, no audio files by construction, 19 tests incl. storage-safety suite). Real no-speaker probe: mono 22050 Hz s16 WAV, ~6 ms first output, artifacts cleaned (334 KiB peak / 0 residual). Storage receipt inside; workspace all-features 2604/0, acceptance 23/23, dictation 8/8. Open: R3 (cloud + quality), PR-1 speech receipt, R20 PR-4 capture items. Not a speaking TUI.
[VRO-17 PR-3 execution](voice-oracle-pr3-execution.md): `VoiceSession` orchestration — typed effects (exactly-one submit, transactional cancel, urgent-ordered speech stops), five-dimension overlap, D21-provenance submission gating, hygiene fed exactly once, pre-identity cancellation applied to the matching late run, idempotent Stop, bounded pending input, validated playback receipts with one-time honest interruption notes, metadata-only reports; 29 tests (four scenario families) against the production session with simulated hosts; reachable-state-by-event table recorded. Also: PR-2 storage-test flake root-caused and fixed (test-isolation defect, adapter zero-file property never violated). Workspace all-features 2633/0 (×3 stable), acceptance 23/23, dictation 8/8. Open: R3, speech receipt, R20, CI targets. Not a speaking TUI.
[VRO-17 PR-4 execution](voice-oracle-pr4-execution.md): opt-in `voice-conversation` TUI feature — ConversationController on the real seams, PlaybackOwner (bounded queue, verified receipt semantics, no files), R20 capture store (hard caps, cross-instance lease reservation, dead-lease recovery), F9/Settings activation, PR-3 note wording corrected. **Synthetic fixture STT gate closed 6/6** (pre-selected criterion; first-attempt miss recorded). TUI default suite 395/0 unchanged (R9); workspace all-features 2657/0; acceptance 23/23. **Device acceptance user-operated and OPEN** — not advertised as working device voice. Build/launch instructions + checklist in §8.
[VRO-17 PR-4 acceptance-readiness addendum](voice-oracle-pr4-execution.md#pr-4-acceptance-readiness-addendum-this-unit): pre-device verification found the previously reported binary **stale** (rebuilt; incremental cost 0 B) and — the material finding — a **demonstrated wiring gap**: F9 gates and shares capture, but the conversation controller/session is constructed only in tests (linker-GC proof: session/playback/store symbols absent from the live path), and no Settings → Voice panel exists (config-file is the only activation route). Conversation checklist items 2–3 **blocked** pending a small, focused binding; dictation regression ready. R9 re-proven at the right boundary (default 395/0; feature-enabled unconfigured constructs nothing; new targeted test; TUI voice-feature 420/0; workspace all-features 2658/0). Storage wording corrected (active capture creates bounded temp files; residual-after-cleanup is the zero-target claim).
[VRO-17 PR-4 binding repair](voice-oracle-pr4-repair.md): both addendum blockers fixed and red→green proven at the production entry points — Settings → Voice panel (palette entry, activation/partials/readiness, persisted through the existing Save flow, immediately effective on F9), lazy `ConversationHost` constructed only on an enabled gesture, origin-tagged transcript routing (F5 composer / F9 conversation final → provenance-gated `submit_stt_final` → `spawn_submitted_prompt` typed-Enter path), ContentDelta→hygiene→TTS→PlaybackOwner with speech-failure isolation, settlement/identity bridges, stop = playback-flush-first, one shared sidecar, and R20 bound to the recorder in feature builds (default-build legacy path recorded as an explicit uncovered gap). `pr4_wiring` 7/7 red→green; TUI default 395/0 (R9), voice-feature 427/0, workspace all-features 2665/0, acceptance 23/23. Artifact sha256 e57eb23d… (identity recorded). **Device acceptance still open (Alex-operated).**
[PR-4 Voice-save blocker fixed](voice-oracle-pr4-repair.md#addendum-voice-settings-save-flow-blocker-alexs-device-test): Alex's user test exposed two one-line defects — the voice save was nested under the web-tools change condition, and voice was absent from the Settings dirty check (so Esc skipped the Save prompt entirely for voice-only changes). Both fixed via a single shared `settings_voice_save` implementation (`voice_dirty` / `voice_save_required`), watched-path added, live-host scope sync on save, failed-save error retained. Red→green proven by reintroducing the defects; pr4_wiring 9/9; TUI default 395/0, voice-feature 429/0, workspace all-features 2667/0, acceptance 23/23. Artifact sha256 a2e3b029…. **Device acceptance still open (Alex-operated retry).**
[PR-4 F9-refusal root-caused & fixed](voice-oracle-pr4-repair.md#addendum-2-f9-refusal-with-saved-on-second-device-test): the gate conflated enabled+readiness AND its engine check `PathBuf::from("espeak-ng").is_file()` resolved against the process CWD — always false in the workspace while `/usr/bin/espeak-ng` sat on PATH (Settings' panel had the same bug). New shared `voice_readiness` module (PATH-resolved existence, named checks+remedies); F9 now separates disabled vs enabled-but-blocked with accurate messages; panel and gate use ONE assessment. Red→green proven against the exact defect; `pr4_f9_gate` 6/6; voice-feature 435/0 ×3; workspace 2673/0; artifact sha256 ebf52b83…. **Device acceptance open (Alex retry).**
[PR-4 second blocker fixed](voice-oracle-pr4-repair.md#addendum-3-the-real-blocker--a-stale-duplicate-enablement-flag): Alex's third test (readiness all-yes but F9 refused) pinned the true cause — `ConversationHost` carried a second `scope_enabled` flag defaulting to false that no production caller ever set (the save-time sync only ran when the host already existed, but the host is lazily created after save). Flag removed; single enablement authority = the F9 gate. Binary verified (stale refusal gone, gate + blocked messages present). pr4_wiring 10/10 incl. gate→host→submit end-to-end; workspace 2674/0; artifact sha256 c34e5df1…. **Device acceptance open (Alex retry; failures now name the actual prerequisite).**
[PR-4 artifact-clobber note](voice-oracle-pr4-repair.md#addendum-4-feature-removed--artifact-clobbered-by-a-default-build): Alex's "you removed the feature" was a default `cargo build` overwriting the feature build at the same path (byte-verified: voice symbols absent, then restored byte-identical c34e5df1…). No code change. Always build with `--features voice-conversation`.
[✅ PR-4 DEVICE ACCEPTANCE PASSED](voice-oracle-pr4-repair.md#device-acceptance--passed-alex-first-live-round-trip): Alex's first live round trip through the production path — spoken no-tool instruction recognized (surfaced as "you (voice): …"), agent ran 0 tools as instructed, text answer produced, audible voice reply observed. Core bidirectional loop closed on-device. Open: live barge-in exercise (optional checklist), PR-5, R3 voice choice, CI targets.
[PR-4 live-use defect fixed: speech died after first barge-in](voice-oracle-pr4-repair.md#addendum-5-live-session-defect--speech-died-permanently-after-the-first-barge-in): Alex's multi-turn session isolated it — `stop_flush` latched `stopped=true` and nothing ever called `reset()`, so every later `begin_stream` silently swallowed audio. Fix: a new stream clears the latch (canceled-stream suppression unchanged, separately tested); regression `new_stream_after_stop_is_audible_again` red→green; playback 10/10; artifact 5d8aa9e8…. **Awaiting Alex's multi-turn+barge-in retry.**
[PR-4 FINAL REPORT — device acceptance passed, live defect fixed](voice-oracle-pr4-repair.md#final-report--pr-4-complete-all-phases-through-device-acceptance--live-defect-fix): consolidates the full phase ledger (recon → PR-0..3 → implementation → two binding repairs → device acceptance → live stop-latch fix) with the final audit: all gates re-verified on the current tree (TUI 395/0 default + 437/0 voice-feature, voice 166/0, dictation 8/8, workspace 2675/0 all-features, fmt/Clippy/arch/naming/acceptance clean), audit findings 1–5 (stale flag, CWD-relative check, stop latch — each red→green proven; waiver narrowing; overstatement corrected in place), honest scope statement, storage delta. **PR-4 CLOSED.** PR-5 open.
[Kokoro-82M local neural voice audition](voice-oracle-local-neural-audition.md): feasibility + listening choices + exact asset budget (~87 MiB) for af_heart/am_michael. Recommended route: ONNX q8f16 + `ort` 1.88 (license-clean, MSRV match) with espeak-ng `--ipa` phonemizer (100% vocab coverage verified). Creator samples verified accessible (af_heart 6 samples; am_michael creator samples absent — CDN sample noted); demo Space verified real (hexgrad). Local probe NOT run (no assets). Integration proposal outlined, not implemented. **Awaiting Alex: listening + budget approval.**
[VRO-17 R3 implementation — Natural Voice pack](voice-oracle-kokoro-implementation.md): the approved Kokoro upgrade landed as an optional, user-installable pack — new dedicated adapter crate `vesper-voice-kokoro` (pack descriptor/integrity/lifecycle, espeak-IPA pronunciation bridge reimplemented from the official pipeline's algorithm, bounded ORT engine, `VoiceTts` adapter, dev-only mock) behind the new default-off TUI feature `voice-kokoro`; Settings → Voice gains engine selection + Install (confirmed dialog with real numbers, real byte progress, Esc-stop, backup/restore, resume), Preview (real adapter + PlaybackOwner, fixed phrase, never a turn), Repair/Verify, measured ownership-safe Remove, and Details (licenses/provenance/location); F9 gate joins the pack+phonemizer checks into the SAME shared assessment (enabled-but-blocked names the prerequisite; no silent fallback). Real setup receipt: production pipeline into the managed per-user cache in 24.3 s, silent synthesis probe passed, Ready published only after probe; retained 117 677 941 B measured (< 256 MiB), peak 120 802 497 B (< 512 MiB). Performance (release, real inference): audio/synthesis ≈ 1.5× (audit correction: this implies conventional RTF ≈ 0.67, not slower-than-real-time), cold init 319 ms, peak RSS 815 MiB, engine usable after cancellation. **Recorded decision: q8f16 SIGSEGVs ORT 1.28.0 CPU → pinned `model_quantized.onnx`** (directive-preauthorized alternative, +6.3 MiB). Gates: fmt/Clippy strict/arch 30 pkgs/naming 36 frozen/acceptance 23/23 clean; workspace all-features 2720/0, default 2505/0; artifact `44e3d8da…` feature build (capability byte-verified; installed binaries untouched). **Open: Alex's listening/F9 acceptance; PR-5.**
[VRO-17 continuity & formatting repair](voice-continuity-phoneme-repair.md): implements the two recon-proposed repairs. Subdivision superseded: the 28/48 micro-cut policy is replaced by clause-sized first piece (onset preserved: genuine clause boundary preferred, honest word fallback) + sentence-level successors within the 510-ID context budget — measured on the repaired path: 5 pieces (was 12), stacked fade-quiet 2.9 s (was 7.2 s), artificial mid-sentence insertions 11→1, agg-RTF unchanged (0.66), paced sink gap-free except ONE quantified 5.2 s cold-start gap at the first big successor (bounded audio-duration prebuffer proposed separately for review, NOT slipped in). Formatting: the hygiene gate now keeps list markers attached to their items (`leading_list_marker` + marker-aware `find_sentence_end` + prefix deferral + `formatting-only` marker at finalize) — the exact device reproducer (`"1."` unit → zero phoneme ids) is fixed red→green through the full PTY production path with word-sized streamed deltas; mandatory distinctions pinned (headings keep their word, `The answer is 1.`/decimals/versions never lose content, symbols-as-content still emit, meaningful zero-phoneme failures stay visible). Open finding recorded: pre-existing decimal-split-at-chunk-boundary limitation. New suite `hygiene_formatting_units` (13, every-character-boundary) + pipeline fixture updated to the superseding policy with onset protection kept. Candidate `agent-vesper-tui-continuity-phoneme-repair` sha256 9d59189a…; prior candidates preserved. Gates: all affected suites + 4 PTY modes + clippy(3)/arch 30/naming 36/acceptance 23/fmt-scoped green. **Alex's 2026-03-03 listening comparison PASSED for this bounded repair: delay remains, but it is “much better then before” and “good enough for now”; residual delay remains open and the continuity verdict stays distinct from software receipts.**
[VRO-17 real NPU speech integration reconnaissance](voice-npu-integration-execution.md): current-machine/runtime and installed-version source audit. FLM 1.0.5 has a concrete standalone Whisper NPU endpoint, but its handler has no verified VAD/silence contract and ignores request cancellation; Vesper's VAD is backend-local, so registration would violate R16 or instantiate the CPU recognizer as a fake NPU result. The ~1 GB model is absent and requires itemized native consent. Kokoro Linux-NPU compatibility remains unestablished. No production code, download, process, candidate, or installed binary changed.
[VRO-17 continuity listening acceptance](voice-continuity-listening-acceptance.md): device closeout for the preserved candidate, including Alex's exact verdict, scope-limited acceptance, root causes, red→green receipts, measured continuity/onset tradeoff, commands, deviations, and explicit residuals. No production code, installer, or installed binary changed.
[VRO-17 continuity & empty-phoneme recon](voice-continuity-phoneme-recon.md): measured reconnaissance after Alex's device feedback (speech restored; long replies pause excessively; some output fails `no pronounceable phonemes`). Pause mechanism quantified on the real engine with a paced sink: every inference piece carries 0.25–0.46 s fade-in/out quiet runs that CONCATENATE at the 28/48 mid-sentence boundaries (7.2 s stacked silence in a 41 s passage; whole-sentence pieces stack 2.9 s at natural pauses); warm RTF 0.63–0.66 sustains pace while cold-start RTF 0.96–0.99 leaves no margin. Empty-phoneme root cause reproduced: numbered-list markers emit `"1."` as a hygiene unit that maps to zero vocab ids (22 symbol chars are zero-id alone; harmless embedded). Minimal repairs proposed (both now implemented by the repair record above). Earlier EPIPE wording corrected (errno = no read end remains; reaping distinction from the paired experiment).
[VRO-17 multi-turn playback repair](voice-multiturn-playback-repair.md): Alex's real-device result recorded as FAILED for repeated-turn playback/continuity (turns 1–2 spoke; from ~turn 3 sentences stopped finishing with repeated `player pipe write failed (device closed?)` under both CPU and Automatic — the registry is empty, so both ran CPU). Cause established layer by layer: EPIPE proves child death (write-after-reap fails; write-after-unreaped-SIGTERM still succeeds into the 64 KiB buffer), the production aplay argv carried `--fatal-errors` whose documented behavior aborts on any recoverable xrun — turning per-piece starvation gaps into mid-stream child death — and the per-segment stream shape explained the warning storm (one player per hygiene sentence; in-segment short-circuiting was already correct). Repairs, red→green (`voice_multiturn_playback`, 11 tests incl. ten consecutive turns in one process, turn-3 death failing once with turns 4–6 recovering, short-consumer honesty, errno preservation): removed `--fatal-errors`, preserved the original io error (kind+OS code) with truthful consequence text, contained dead streams (fail-fast remaining pieces; fresh child next turn), made exit-0-before-stdin-close a failure, fixed appended-stream byte accounting. Candidate `target/voice-candidates/agent-vesper-tui-multiturn-repair` sha256 7bd31168…; prior candidate preserved. STT garbling recorded OPEN (faster-whisper base/int8 CPU; `vad_filter=True` pinned; no forced language ⇒ per-chunk auto-detect — hypotheses only, no STT change). Gates: new suite 11/11, voice suites + PTY (direct/VRO/Preview) green, clippy/arch/naming/acceptance green, scoped fmt clean; MSRV/CI/cargo-deny not run. **Real-device retest of the repair showed speech restored; continuity/phoneme issues now owned by the recon record above. No acoustic or NPU claims.**
[VRO-17 CPU production acceptance](voice-cpu-production-acceptance.md): the running CPU voice application verified through its real event loop — PTY loop regression in all three modes (direct, VRO, Settings Preview) with isolation pre-verified (loopback-only provider, deterministic recorder/STT/player doubles, hard-linked verified pack), and three defects repaired red→green: Preview ignored the TTS execution policy (now resolves through the same shared rule as F9 via `voice_accel::preview_policy_gate`), a no-op Settings save rebuilt the acoustic engine (unchanged selection now sends no Replace), and a pack-screen action off-by-one made the Preview row fire Repair (rows/indexes now derive from one ordered action list; caught BY the production-loop check, not by unit tests alone). New suites `voice_policy_parity` (7) and `voice_interruption_lifecycle` (5: five interruption cycles then full-turn recovery, no transcript replay, failure-before-audio recovery, session-exit clean lane, Preview worker lifetime). Release-profile application timings recorded stage-distinct (Preview click-to-first-PCM 1.75–2.87 s PTY; warm worker 1.56–2.49 s; F9 stop-to-first-PCM 2.44–3.18 s incl. synthetic STT/provider holds; long-unit 1.7–2.7 s). Preserved candidate `target/voice-candidates/agent-vesper-tui-voice-cpu-acceptance` sha256 d633b4c3…, identity re-verified. Gates: clippy -D warnings (3 feature sets), architecture 28, naming 33, acceptance 23/23, scoped fmt clean, docs links/whitespace clean; MSRV/cross-target/CI/cargo-deny not run. Its single-turn software receipts stand with their stated scope; sustained real-device playback failed afterward and is owned by the repair record above.
[VRO-17 capability-gated execution](voice-capability-gated-execution.md): the clarified R16 direction implemented as production selection policy — pure-core stage execution policy (CPU / Automatic-verified-only / strict-NPU per stage; ten evidence-based readiness facts; in-process readiness cache with invalidation; honest offload attribution), the honest empty accelerator registry (no NPU route registered/offered), F9 gate stage-policy resolution, Settings → Voice compute menus, and `[voice]` scope persistence (`stt_compute`/`tts_compute`, default `cpu`). Ten production-path regressions prove the no-NPU matrix incl. zero-accelerator-call CPU policy, ordinary-CPU Automatic, stage independence, stale-strict revalidation, and no fabricated placement success. CPU candidate preserved (Preview first-PCM 1.684–1.693 s; long-unit 1.674 s fixture receipts). Gates: fmt (scoped)/Clippy/arch 28/naming 33/acceptance 23/23; vesper-voice 85+42, TUI voice 278 lib + 10 policy + 20 pr4/r3 + 9 pipeline; default TUI lib 242 (R9 parity). Artifact d86389a3… capability-verified. **NPU STT/TTS remain open unimplemented gates; no device/PR-5 claims.**
[Execution report and audit](voice-oracle-kokoro-implementation.md#13-production-routing-repair-and-audit):

### VRO-17 R3 — production-routing repair (current acceptance remains open)

[Execution report and audit](voice-oracle-kokoro-implementation.md#13-production-routing-repair-and-audit):
F9-scoped host speech instructions, terminal-only answer routing, enqueue-time
cancellation identity, truthful player errors, bounded worker admission, and
nonblocking Stop ownership. Removed the production reply-injection shortcut;
the real binary now passes loopback provider-wire + real Kokoro tests for
Michael/direct and Heart/VRO, with microphone/player doubles and baseline speech
rejected. Local feature build produced; no device, live-provider or release
acceptance claimed. Earlier implementation-complete language is withdrawn.

[Increment 18 — Resolve vertical slice VERIFIED](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2s-resolve-vertical-slice.md): import → timeline → render → **output file frame-exact verified (2245/2245, full decode RC=0)**, original sha256 unchanged; free-edition codec/import defects measured and fixed (no H.264 in free; ImportMedia string form; CustomName breaks AddRenderJob).
[Increment 19 — paste-free autonomous worker](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2t-paste-free-worker.md): **one paste per launch, then fully autonomous** file-driven control via LuaJIT-FFI channel (`ffi.C.fopen`); second render executed zero-human and frame-verified 2245/2245; `%w`-excludes-underscore and pattern bugs found live.
[Increment 20 — Elisa via MPRIS: second app PASS](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2u-elisa-mpris.md): **40 seconds, zero per-app code** — play verified at 3 layers (state/position/PipeWire stream); the ladder claim measured against Resolve's 4-hour archaeology.
[Increment 21 — native adapter integration](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2v-native-adapter-integration.md): `AdapterPort` seam + Resolve file-IPC and MPRIS adapters behind the **real** `bridge_execute` authorization path — **live-tested against both running applications**; adapters are dependency-free (busctl/file only).
[Increment 22 — §7 dispatch-integrity hardening](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2w-dispatch-hardening.md): timeout-after-mutation now settles `unknown_outcome` (never `failed`); **duplicate suppression re-keyed from attempt-id to operation identity** (the old key could never catch a real retry); step-5a semantic suppression precedes freshness. Live re-verified on both apps.
[Increment 23 — latency investigation](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2x-latency-investigation.md): reported latency root-caused to a **10s test-ceiling window × my full-suite-between-steps procedure**, not the product — Bridge path measured **22 ms** end-to-end; ceiling override 10s→1s (suite 10.0s→1.3s); live latency-budget test (<1s) added as regression guard.
[Increment 24 — three-track choreography](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2y-three-track-choreography.md): 30s/15s/30s three-phase sequenced control PASS (±274 ms); **Elisa crash under rapid Next/Previous inversion found** — app defect, spaced-calls mitigation recorded for adapters.
[Increment 25 — measured-behavior adapter guards](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2z-adapter-behavior-guards.md): adapter refuses previous-while-paused (restart trap), enforces a 1200ms inversion cooldown (crash trigger), and settles navigation only on **trackid change** — all three guards tested against a scripted bus fake and re-verified live.
[Increment 26 — audio-event stop](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2aa-audio-event-stop.md): kick-drum onset **located from the waveform** (low-band transient analysis: 59.28s, the drop); played 30s→59.5s, stopped +216ms past onset, app closed; MPRIS **Seek-is-relative** semantics discovered and recorded.
[Increment 27 — first-kick correction](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2ab-first-kick-correction.md): Alex's ground truth (kick at **51s**, continuous after) confirmed by re-analysis at the right threshold — my "59s drop" was a narrative over incomplete data; test re-run, stopped at 51.9s. Lesson: detectors report structure + uncertainty; human ground truth re-examines, never gets overridden.
[Increment 28 — wave detector calibrated](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2ad-wave-detector.md): `tools/bridge/kick_detector.py` — first sustained kick entry from waveform alone; **5 pipeline stages each earned by a measured failure**; validated blind on two artist-confirmed tracks (51.55 vs 51.5; 56.46 vs 56.0); FX fills (run≤3) vs kick entries (run≥4) discriminator.
[Increment 29 — FX-fill choreography](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2ae-fx-fill-choreography.md): FX fill located at **27.88s** (sharpness 11.7); interleaved beat/half-time patterns disambiguated with one human question; 4th kick = **59.11s**; played from the fill, stopped on the 4th (+428 ms).
[Increment 30 — repeat choreography + close](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2af-fx-fill-repeat.md): full user-level task end-to-end — both waveform facts **independently re-derived** (no cached values), 4th-kick stop at **+98 ms** (tightest yet), Elisa closed and verified gone.
[Increment 31 — video edit delivered](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2ag-video-edit-delivery.md): Suno banner **blurred 175–185s (edge-energy verified 10× collapse)**, LinkedIn MP4 (1080p30, 172 MB) produced, original sha256 untouched; six Resolve-Fusion free-edition findings recorded; blur executed via ffmpeg after the scripted Fusion route proved unrenderable.
[Increment 32 — v2 full-panel fix](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2ah-video-edit-v2.md): v1 rejection accepted (region missed lower rows; coverage gaps) — full panel square blurred 172–188s (Alex-confirmed only visible window), verified unreadable on the delivered file, original intact.
[Increment 33 — v3 full-height blur](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2ah-video-edit-v3.md): Alex's screenshot showed text below AND above the v2 box — row-profile scan measured the panel at y 0.04–0.93; v3 blurs the full window height 174–187s, verified 0.04–0.24 edge inside vs 1.1–3.8 outside. Worker-loop Console blocking, item-query and timeline-shell behaviors recorded.
[Increment 34 — v4 tight text-box](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2ah-video-edit-v4.md): "Too big!" — box re-sized to the text block only (x 460–1573, y 378–831); inside 0.11 vs outside 1.4–5.7 edge energy; outside content sharp, full decode clean.
[Increment 35 — /usage regression root-caused](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2ai-usage-regression.md): live-wire evidence — Z.ai account exhausted (chat 429 `1113`), monitor answers HTTP 200 error-envelope; client bug fixed red-first (4/4) so the panel now says "Z.ai quota monitor reported an account error" instead of blaming malformed protocol; PTY loop on the real release binary PASS; plan recharge is Alex's manual action.
[Increment 36 — Manor Lords input fixed, flow documented](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2aj-manor-lords-status.md): menu-clicking root cause found — XWayland pointer mapping ×1.4 + `mousemove --sync` hangs forever (never use); clicks + spectacle observation proven, full tutorial video decoded frame-by-frame (dev-popup Continue, C=construction NOT B); reached in-game HUD twice; village build BLOCKED on identifying one setup screen — Alex's one-word answer unblocks.
[Increment 36 — Manor Lords mission](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2aj-manor-lords.md): menu-clicking **FIXED** (xdotool `--sync` hangs on XWayland; HiDPI real=logical×1.4 mapping measured; keys reach game) — launched, New Game, region+START, dev-popup Continue all navigated live; docs read properly (C=construction confirmed from keycap glyphs; Alex's correction verified); **village placement BLOCKED** by raw-input in-world cursor (needs ydotool/uinput); game exited via accidental Quit — no new save on disk, recorded honestly.
[Increment 37 — input injection engineered](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2ak-input-injection.md): `vesper_pointer.py` builds full uinput stack userland (correct `input_event` `<qqHHi` layout, UI_DEV_SETUP API); devices register and KWin lists them as pointers — **events dropped at compositor seat arbitration** (measured, with journal evidence); 5 injection routes tested and mapped; game relaunched, menu control re-verified; single unblock action recorded (sudo install ydotoold).
— portal probe **executed under Alex's approval: PASS at OS level** (4
real 2880×1800 captures via the xdg Screenshot portal) — but the earlier
hypothesis "portal unblocks Cua capture" is **refuted by measurement**:
0.28.1's wayland-helper is GNOME-Shell-only and upstream states KDE
needs a KWin activation adapter "not yet provided" (libei input is
focus-global). Certifiable lanes listed: X11/GNOME session or the KWin
adapter; none claimed supported. Resolve **free 21.1 confirmed to exist
for Linux** (API: `davinci-resolve` 21.1.014) but the zip sits behind a
JS registration flow — probed page/bundle/API/CDN, no bypass used, two
manual options offered. **Enrollment fixed and ARMED** to the original
PRD (234 ≤ 512 ceiling); takes effect on Alex's TUI restart — no
Settings typing needed.

[Vesper Bridge Increment 14](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2o-installs-report.md)
— installs executed under Alex's explicit authorization: repaired
Vesper binaries installed (installed bytes verified to carry the
512-paragraph ceiling; running process left untouched); **Cua Driver
0.28.1 digest-verified** (`a068b6e4…` exact) and installed
(`~/.local/opt/cua-driver-rs-0.28.1/`, telemetry disabled, daemon
serving); first real lane measurements: screen size and
process/window tree PASS, **full-display capture BLOCKED** (X11 Match
on GetImage — stock-Wayland session, no portal path in 0.28.1; manual
action: KWin ScreenCast portal probe or an X session). Input tools
listed, not exercised. Resolve remains the sole fully-external blocker.

[Vesper Bridge Final Audit](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2n-final-audit.md)
— hand re-derivation of every invariant claim: **found a 13th defect —
increment 13 had greened its suite by editing the test to assert the
broken behavior** (resume-from-Paused stayed `Paused`; report claimed
"dispatchable"). Corrected in place: `resume()` now transitions Paused →
Recovering, the test asserts the correct state and fails on pre-audit
code; bridge **68/68**. **First complete workspace run of the mission:
`cargo test --workspace` → 162 targets ok / 0 failures** (closing the
gap that the four MSRV-clippy-touched crates had only been compiled,
never test-run: sandbox 19/0, agent 424+474/0, memory 120/0, swarm
331/0); AT-01 PTY re-run PASS post-lifecycle-change; clippy ×2, fmt,
acceptance 23/23 green. Producer/consumer table verified by hand for all
7 session states, 7 outcomes, and both lease terminals.
**ADR 0030 promoted** (recon drafts AD-01…AD-08 → accepted record;
`docs/adr/0030-vesper-bridge-application-control.md`; index updated;
post-promotion gates green).

[Vesper Bridge Increment 13](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2m-increment-report.md)
— **`Paused`/`Closed` had no producers** (state machine could never
enter them; increment 12's recorded debt), and production
`bridge_disconnect` **silently discarded** held-input leases and
outstanding jobs behind a flat "session closed". Added `pause()` (Ready/
Recovering only; cannot weaken quarantine) and `close()` (terminal,
idempotent); disconnect now surfaces unresolved inputs/jobs before
closing. Red-first 3/3 (two compile-fail proofs); bridge **68/68**;
harness 142/0+116/0; ACP 84/0; TUI 395/0; clippy ×2 clean; gates green.
**The reachability sweep is complete: 12 defects of this class, every
enum state now has producer + consumer.**

[Vesper Bridge Increment 12](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2l-increment-report.md)
— **`OperationOutcome::Cancelled` and `Partial` were unreachable**: §7
enumerates them but no code path anywhere constructed either — a
cancellation could never be recorded as a cancellation. Added
`cancel()` (terminal, not success, reservations deliberately retained
per §7) and `settle_partial()`; red-first 3/3 (two as compile-fail
proofs of absent APIs). Bridge **65/65**; harness 142/0; clippy ×2
clean; gates green. `Paused`/`Closed` recorded honestly as
representation debt (no producers) for the adapter phase. Defects
10–11 of the reachability sweep.

[Vesper Bridge Increment 11](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2k-increment-report.md)
— **quarantine lifecycle broken two ways**: `resume()` on a Quarantined
session returned Ok (the host then claimed "admission open" while every
dispatch stayed denied — a truthful-reporting lie), and NO code path
cleared `Quarantined` (one uncertain outcome permanently bricked the
session). Red-first 2/2: quarantined resume now refuses with
`CleanupUnconfirmed`; evidence-backed reconcile moves Quarantined →
Recovering (resume+fresh observation still gate dispatch). Bridge
**62/62**; harness 142/0+116/0; ACP 84/0; TUI 395/0; clippy ×2 clean;
gates green. Ninth reachability defect of the mission.

[Vesper Bridge Increment 10](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2j-increment-report.md)
— **`InputLeaseState::Released` was unreachable**: no code path anywhere
constructed it; `stop()` always reported `Unconfirmed` forever (BR-17
settlement could never terminate) and increment 8's emergency path would
re-report settled inputs. Added explicit host confirmation
(`confirm_input_release` → `settle_input_release` clearing live+stranded
input records), `/bridge release confirmed` in both hosts, settled vs
UNCONFIRMED stop wording. Red-first 2/2; bridge **60/60**; harness
142/0+116/0; ACP 84/0; TUI 395/0; clippy ×2 clean; gates green; real-TUI
PTY proof. Eighth reachability defect of the mission.

[Vesper Bridge Increment 9](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2i-increment-report.md)
— **no production stop path existed**: the eight-tool surface had no stop,
`stop_for_tests` was the only trigger, and `/bridge stop`'s text pointed
at a tool that did not exist. Added production `stop()`/`resume()` on the
service (synchronous, no model inference, truthful reports), exposed via
`HarnessToolService::bridge_stop/bridge_resume`, executed by BOTH hosts
(`/bridge stop|resume`); TUI keeps a concrete feature-gated session
handle (trait object erasure). 4 new production-route tests; real-TUI PTY
proof ("no session … nothing to stop" — honest). Harness **142/0** on /
116/0 off; ACP 84/0; TUI 395/0; bridge 58/0; clippy ×2 clean; gates green.

[Vesper Bridge Increment 8](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2h-increment-report.md)
— **§8.4/NF-03 violation found and repaired**: emergency input release
scanned only live leases, so an input-holding lease revoked in an
ordinary stop vanished from the emergency path (stranded key/button);
worse, the unit test named `revocation_does_not_strand_emergency_release`
asserted exactly the stranding (`released.is_empty()`). Red-first 3/3,
corrected unit contract, `stranded_inputs` retention drains once per
generation. Bridge suite **58/58**; harness 137/0; clippy ×2 clean;
gates green. Lesson: a green test named for a safety property is not
evidence of the property.

[Vesper Bridge Increment 7](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2g-increment-report.md)
— core-side bounded state (NF-05/07/08, AT-37): `MAX_OPERATION_RECORDS`/
`MAX_OUTSTANDING_JOBS` enforced in the core with oldest-first eviction
(never refusal), **and the production-path `MemoryJournal` bounded**
(`MAX_RECORDS`, evicted ids read honestly as Fresh), red-first 5/5 then
55/55 green; **second latent bug found**: request ids derived from
`records.len()` would collide with journal entries after eviction
(~512 ops) and misfire BR-16 duplicate suppression — replaced with a
monotonic `request_sequence`. All pinned source digests re-verified
16/16; enrollment-ceiling probe PASS under `--ignored`; repo gates green.

[Vesper Bridge Increment 6](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2f-increment-report.md)
— TUI AT-01 lane closed via real-binary PTY observation (`bridge_at01_pty.py`:
kernel children + `ss` socket equality, both settings states); the new test
**exposed a real defect** — the TUI silently dropped `/bridge` commands
(dispatch stored the pending command, main loop never consumed it) — repaired
by moving the answer text to shared `vesper-harness::bridge_command` (both
hosts consume one implementation, BR-21) and adding the missing TUI consumer.
Harness 137/0 (+3 shared-answer tests), TUI 395/0, ACP 84/0 & 83/0, bridge
50/0, clippy clean on 1.88.0 + stable, architecture 28, acceptance 23/23.

[Vesper Bridge Increment 5](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2e-increment-report.md)
— AT-01 OS-observation lane closed for the ACP host: real-process test
(`bridge_at01_os_observation.rs`, `bridge`+unix gated) proving an
enabled-but-idle Bridge host holds **no child processes**
(`/proc/<pid>/task/*/children`), **no TCP sockets beyond the disabled
baseline** (`ss -tnp -H`), and **no durable state**; both settings
states verified via `/bridge status` transcript. ACP 84/0 with bridge,
83/0 without; clippy clean on 1.88.0 and stable; architecture 28,
naming-guard 33 frozen, acceptance 23/23. TUI observation + adapter
lanes remain open/blocked.

[Vesper Bridge Increment 4](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2d-increment-report.md)
— MSRV 1.88 closed for the bridge combination (workspace-wide `+1.88.0`
clippy `--all-targets --all-features` clean after mechanical lint fixes
in 10 files); **self-deadlock found and repaired** in
`BridgeToolService::replay_observation` (std Mutex re-lock; gdb-pinned),
invalidating the phase2b "131 passed" receipt — corrected receipt 134
passed/0 failed, reproducible single- and multi-threaded; missing
observation no longer mints a synthetic fresh one (BR-15 freshness
enforced, denial precedence preserved); all repo gates green
(architecture 28, naming-guard 33 frozen, acceptance 23/23).

[Vesper Bridge Increment 3](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2c-increment-report.md)
— Cua 0.28.1 provenance pinned (digest `a068b6e4…`, **prerelease** noted;
install BLOCKED pending Alex's authorization), living compatibility
manifest published (per-lane manual actions), +4 contract-invariant tests
(NF-10 retry matrix over all errors, idempotency totality, capture-identity
reuse, outcome classification). Bridge suite now 50 deterministic tests.

[Vesper Bridge Phase 1 completion](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase1-fake-driver-report.md)
— deterministic `FakeApplication` driver in testkit + 6 end-to-end
scenarios (verify-once, restart invalidation, ack-without-effect,
reconcile-before-retry, shared-fence two-writers, unknown-op rejection);
core hardened red-first (verify requires independent evidence; leases are
per-resource across sessions); MSRV 1.88 checks clean for all new units;
clippy/fmt/architecture/naming-guard green. Contract-class evidence only.

[Vesper Bridge Phase 2b](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2b-report.md) —
host wiring: shared `bridge-settings.json` (fail-closed, atomic, symlink-
refusing) + once-per-process holder, host-neutral `/bridge` descriptor,
TUI/ACP advertisement parity under a default-off feature in both hosts,
ACP `/bridge` handler (read-only host answers), with_bridge no-op variant.
Harness 131/116 (on/off), ACP 16 targets both ways, TUI green, clippy/
fmt/architecture(28)/naming-guard/xtask-acceptance(23/23). AT-34 and
OS-level AT-01 remain NOT TESTED.

[Vesper Bridge Phase 2](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase2-report.md) —
harness composition behind default-off `bridge` feature: 8-tool surface,
advertisement gating proven both ways (0 tools disabled / refusal on
direct call; 8 + honest no-adapter refusals enabled), gate-order repair
(denial precedence), 126 harness tests with feature, 116 without,
clippy/fmt/architecture(28)/naming-guard/xtask-acceptance(23/23) green.
Host TUI/ACP wiring still open; all 44 AT rows formally NOT TESTED.

[Vesper Bridge Phase 1](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase1-report.md) —
`vesper-bridge` pure core landed: 46 deterministic tests (denial, stale
generation/observation, lease fencing, duplicate suppression,
ack≠verified, stop/quarantine), clippy `-D warnings` clean, architecture
gate now 28 packages, naming-guard clean. All 44 AT rows still NOT
TESTED; MSRV 1.88 check unexecuted; Phase 2+ not started.

[Vesper Bridge Phase 0 reconnaissance](../Vesper%20bridge/recon/phase0-report.md)
— VB-PRD-001 rev 1.0 architecture verdict: baseline revalidated at
`5a3ce20`, integration map to file/symbol level, Cua 0.28.1 + Resolve
scripting evidence refreshed and digest-pinned, adapter decision
(Studio-scripting sidecar + Cua stdio leaf on the X11/XWayland lane),
threat model/AT plan, ADR drafts. Enrollment mechanically blocked by the
256-paragraph ceiling (283 measured); Resolve not installed (lane BLOCKED);
all 44 AT rows NOT TESTED.

[Enrollment ceiling repair](enrollment-ceiling-repair.md) — raises
`MAX_REQUIREMENTS` 256→512 red-first (284-paragraph VB-PRD-001 case),
honest `(found N)` error text, real-PRD probe; acceptance gate 23/23,
architecture/clippy/fmt clean. Session `acceptance_enroll` still runs the
pre-repair installed binary and refuses — hosting-process restart pending
(user-side).

[v0.23.0 release execution](v0.23.0-release-execution.md) — first minor
bump: acceptance-freeze fix with final audit repair, rustls
RUSTSEC-2026-0285 bump. 4/4 CI green on `f4a2eea` before the tag;
16 assets; registry PR #539 updated in place (byte-identical).

[Acceptance enrollment audit](acceptance-enrollment-audit.md) — final
audit of the enrollment visibility unit: found AC-3 untested and the
ceiling missing the contract ladder (true worst case ~17 min, not ~5);
both repaired red-first with in-process freeze reproduction (1,208 s
receipt). Floor 2,331/0; acceptance 23/23.

[Acceptance enrollment visibility](acceptance-enrollment-visibility-execution.md)
fixes the field-reported acceptance freeze: nested reviewer agents now
stream `Status` stage lines to both hosts, the contract ladder is capped
at 2 attempts with a 300 s enrollment ceiling, and refusal/failure is one
loud actionable outcome instead of a silent grind. Red-first receipts;
all pre-existing acceptance pins green; 2,329/0. **Superseded in part by
the audit above** (ceiling coverage, AC-3 test).

[v0.22.9 release](v0.22.9-release-execution.md) publishes the voice
silence-hallucination guard: all four exact-commit gates on `342f5b1`,
16 verified assets, registry PR #539 updated in place (byte-identical
read-back), local installation preserved.

[Voice VAD silence guard](voice-vad-silence-guard-execution.md) fixes the
"1 min"×77 trailing-silence hallucination: the sidecar now passes
`vad_filter=True` on every call (measured: 30 s zeros → "You" unfiltered,
"" filtered). Red-first PTY receipt, real-model probe, all harnesses
assert the kwarg.

[v0.22.8 release](v0.22.8-release-execution.md) publishes the voice
F5-cancel repair: all four exact-commit gates on `4a37af5`, 16 verified
assets, unauthenticated latest discovery, registry PR #539 updated in
place (byte-identical read-back), local installation preserved.

[Voice F5-cancel trap repair](voice-f5-cancel-trap-repair.md) fixes the
field-reported "Voice preparation cancelled" dead end: F5 during first-use
preparation used to cancel the multi-minute install (the feature's own
toggle key); it is now a no-op with Del as the explicit cancel. Red-first
regression test, PTY suite green, workspace 2,326/0.

[v0.22.7 release](v0.22.7-release-execution.md) records the score-floor
initiative publication after reconciling with the concurrent v0.22.4–v0.22.6
releases via rebase: all four exact-commit gates on `574c224`, 16 verified
assets, registry PR #539 updated in place, local installation preserved at
0.22.6.

[Voice-control implementation](voice-control-execution.md) tracks the requested
dynamic footer and long-dictation repair; verification is in progress.

[Voice-control recon](voice-control-recon.md) identifies the footer omission in
`e924596` and the fixed 90-second transcription timeout/audio-loss path; dynamic
control and long-dictation recovery are specified, not yet implemented.

[v0.22.5 release](v0.22.5-release-execution.md) records successful exact-commit gates, five-platform publication, download verification and registry PR #539 update. Local installation was preserved.

[Guided dependency setup](dependency-setup-execution.md) records 2,315 passing
workspace tests, 23 acceptance cases, Rust 1.88 compatibility and real isolated
Linux setup through CLI and Settings. Clean-platform installation and restart
acceptance remain pending; publication is recorded separately above, with no local update.


Status: evidence index; acceptance status is scoped to each section.

## Dependency setup reconnaissance — COMPLETE; implementation proposed — 2026-09-13

[Dependency setup recon](dependency-setup-recon.md) identifies the missing engine
installation/start/health workflow and proposes shared native setup with real
readiness checks, reboot recovery and preservation of existing user state.
No dependencies were installed and no implementation acceptance is claimed.

## Security policy refresh — COMPLETE — 2026-09-13

[Execution record](security-policy-refresh.md) records removal of stale Stage 1
claims from the public Security page, current permission/data guidance, and
text-only review without program tests or a release.

## v0.22.4 routing preview release — COMPLETE — 2026-09-13

[Release execution](v0.22.4-release-execution.md) records published tag `v0.22.4`
on `fdac018`, all four exact-commit gates, five successful builds, 16 verified
assets, existing registry PR #539 updated in place, README/user-guide refresh,
and preserved local installation.
Routing quality remains a documented preview; release does not mark the PRD complete.

## Intelligent skill routing — model-assisted implementation and live regression; quality HOLD — 2026-09-13

[Model-assisted execution](skill-routing-model-assistance-execution.md) records the
approved opt-in, native integration and scoped offline verification (2,305 workspace
tests and 23 acceptance cases). [Independent live scoring](skill-routing-model-live-evaluation.md)
records the completed 205-case provider pass: 89/95 positive recall, 0/60 no-skill
activations, 2/30 forbidden-sibling activations; all 488 library files preserved.
[Independent evaluation](skill-routing-independent-execution.md) records the frozen
205-case corpus and retained failures. [Request recognition](skill-routing-request-recognition-execution.md)
records lexical changes; none of these passing plumbing tests establishes live routing accuracy.

## Optional semantic routing experiment — ongoing, not native acceptance

[Experiment report](skill-routing-embedding-experiment.md) records pinned local
models, metadata-only probes, development calibration and all measured regressions.
No embedding route or model has been installed into Vesper.

## Skill routing language follow-up — lexical verification passed, quality HOLD — 2026-09-13

[Execution report](skill-routing-language-execution.md) records the follow-up to the
initial quality HOLD. Original labels and prediction receipts are preserved;
new development results do not substitute for held-out acceptance.

## Skill routing preview — promotion HOLD — 2026-09-13

[Implementation report](skill-routing-quality-implementation.md) records shared
selection, native controls, preserved library hashes, runtime checks and unmet
quality gates. [Frozen predictions](skill-routing-quality-results.json) and
[summary helper](skill-routing-quality-summary.py) retain all four ablations.
Standard remains default; combined score-floor integration is pending GLM PR-2/PR-3.

## Routing / score-floor coexistence — 2026-09-13

[Reconnaissance](skill-routing-coexistence-recon.md) records GLM PR-1 commit
`5cf5835`, overlapping files, isolated routing checkout, library preservation and
required combined acceptance. Implementation is approved; final acceptance pending.
## Score-floor MASTER AUDIT — 2026-09-13

[Master audit](chunk-score-floor-master-audit.md) re-traces all six ACs to
current code, sabotage-verifies all five pins (gate-revert and
matcher-revert both flip their pins red), and re-derives invariants by
hand. Findings: PR-2's row miscount corrected in place ("three" → two;
the factual-retrieval row was unchanged — its second chunk routes on a
genuine `pipeline` overlap), stale-table supersession noted in the PR-4
eval report, silent flag-on branch closed in `metadata_fields`. No code
defects; initiative verdict COMPLETE upheld. Floor 2,258/0, acceptance
23/23, naming-guard 18 frozen.

## Chunk score-floor PR-3 / initiative COMPLETE — 2026-09-13

[PR-3 execution](chunk-score-floor-pr3-execution.md) restores the exemplar
G5 proof to its literal zero-chunks form. Stop rule fired and resolved
test-side: the original prompt was never vocabulary-free (`finished` →
`finish` overlaps phase4's description); corrected fixture verified
zero-overlap across all 16 chunk pools while still carrying sub-floor
hash noise (phase8 +0.1826 → 401 pts). Non-vacuity receipts on the
pre-PR-2 tree (3 noise chunks routed). All 6 PRD ACs re-traced; floor
2,258/0, acceptance 23/23, clippy/fmt/naming-guard clean. Initiative
closed.

## Chunk score-floor Q1 — 2026-09-13

[Q1 execution](chunk-score-floor-q1-execution.md) closes the embedded-name
admission bypass: chunk names now match delimiter-bounded
(`chunk_name_matches`), so `comet` no longer admits from `pcometq` or
`auto-comet-review`, while delimited addressing still routes. Red-first
pin + control; skill-tier `phrase_matches` untouched. Floor 2,258,
acceptance 23/23, clippy/fmt/naming-guard clean.

## Chunk score-floor PR-2 — 2026-09-13

[PR-2 execution](chunk-score-floor-pr2-execution.md) lands the conjunction gate
`(overlap >= 1 || name_match) && score >= MIN_CHUNK_ROUTING_SCORE (520)` in
`rank_chunks`: cosine can only rank, never admit. Anchor unignored and green;
stop-rule probe proved the two changed D3 rows were themselves zero-overlap
cosine admissions (AC-3 letter corrected in the PRD). Floor 2,256, acceptance
23/23, clippy clean, naming-guard clean. Skill tier byte-identical.

## Skill routing quality proposal — 2026-09-13

[Research execution](skill-routing-quality-research.md) links the
[proposed PRD](../skill-routing-quality-prd.md), creator video metadata, primary
research and current code findings. Design only: no routing-quality benchmark or
implementation claimed; full video/caption access limitations are explicit.

## Dollar-token skill routing repair — 2026-09-13

[Repair execution](dollar-skill-routing-repair.md) reproduces pasted LaTeX being
misread as a missing skill and records shared TUI/ACP routing repair and limits.



## GitHub front-page refresh — 2026-09-13

[Execution report](readme-refresh-execution.md) records the README update for
native installation, Settings, activity rendering and confirmed updates. Alex’s
five screenshots establish the Linux 0.22.2 → 0.22.3 update and restart, appended
to the release report; other platform and coding-output visual checks remain open.

## v0.22.3 visual upgrade release — 2026-09-13

[Release execution](v0.22.3-release-execution.md) tracks version synchronization,
exact-commit gates and completed publication on `e9364de`: all four prerequisites
and release run 34709443693 passed; 16 public assets and unauthenticated latest
discovery verified; registry PR #539 updated in place. Installed 0.22.2 hashes
remain unchanged for Alex's updater test.

## Native output visual upgrade — 2026-09-13

[Execution report](output-visual-upgrade-execution.md) traces the
[visual PRD](../output-visual-upgrade-prd.md): chronological colored activity,
truthful animated status, numbered syntax-colored diffs and responsive aligned
reports. Repository verification passed (2,247 workspace tests; 23 acceptance
cases), final renderer 240/0, changed-crate MSRV 924/0, and native Settings PTY
regression passed. Actual renderer images are linked in the report. Native
Windows/macOS visual acceptance remains open. Subsequent publication is recorded
in the v0.22.3 release report above; the installed 0.22.2 remains unchanged.

## v0.22.2 Settings repair release — 2026-09-12

[Release execution](v0.22.2-release-execution.md) tracks the authorized version
bump and completed publication: all four exact-commit gates passed on `c9c85fe`,
release run 34703586198 published 16 assets, and registry PR #539 was updated
in place. The user subsequently authorized initial installation on 2026-09-13:
archive checksum passed, both installed binaries report 0.22.2 and bundled
driver setup succeeded. A future-version in-app update test remains pending.

## Native Settings and confirmed updates — 2026-09-12

[Execution report](settings-and-update-execution.md) traces
[the repair PRD](../settings-and-update-prd.md): shared themed menus, grouped
save/discard, persisted execution choices, protected automatic PRD enrollment,
and a confirmed installer workflow. Final all-feature workspace: 2,234 passed,
0 failed, 34 ignored; changed-crate MSRV: 548 passed, 0 failed, 4 ignored.
Native terminal and checksum/install fixtures passed. Windows native updater
execution remains unverified; no release or user installation was performed.

## Session push: context paging + productization + hardening planning — 2026-09-12

`push-context-paging-execution.md` records pushing the session's three
completed work units to `origin/main` (`637eb7e..a378bd8`, four commits)
after fresh gates on the exact tree: workspace 2,218/0, acceptance 20/20,
naming-guard clean. Two initially misplaced files were corrected pre-push
(one amend, one follow-up docs commit). Ranker-hardening PR-1..3 remain
PLANNING and are the resumption point.

## Ranker hardening PRD (alias cross-talk) — 2026-09-12

`ranker-hardening-prd-execution.md` records drafting
`docs/ranker-hardening-prd.md` from the alias cross-talk recon: scope fenced
to Option A (raw stemmed chunk pools; `rank_chunks` bypasses the alias loop,
skill tier untouched) + Option D (failing cross-talk fixture anchors the
defect before the fix), incident quantified at 1,560 manufactured overlap
points (`skill_orchestrator.rs:869/:873`), bounded 520-pt prompt-side
residual disclosed as accepted, three PRs (anchor → decoupling → re-eval
with a D3-verdict stop rule). migration-status row PLANNING; naming-guard
clean. No code changed.

## Alias cross-talk swarm recon (ranker hardening) — 2026-09-12

`recon-alias-crosstalk-execution.md` records the read-only recon mission
behind `architecture/recon_alias_crosstalk.md`: exact bleed mechanism
(slug tokens enter only via the prompt pool at skill_orchestrator.rs:421-422
and join chunk pools at :869; the PR-4 incident scored 1,560 manufactured
points, not 520), blast radius proven zero over the shipped floor under
either one-sided alias ablation, four decoupling options ranked with
recommendation A+D, and two latent defect classes empirically pinned
(stem-form alias asymmetry `releases→releas`; dead hyphenated alias rows).
No production code changed. naming-guard clean, 18 frozen hits.

## Completion-reporting workflow productized — 2026-09-12

`completion-reporting-workflow-execution.md` records shipping the session's
reporting/audit conventions as default installed behavior: shared
`COMPLETION_REPORTING_INSTRUCTION` in `vesper-harness` injected by both
hosts at every loop build (ACP interactive+worker, TUI direct+tool-loop)
with byte-for-byte parity tests in both apps; the `work-unit-reporting`
seed skill (library 94→95, bundle registered, mirrored) teaches report
structure, final-audit regression-first discipline, and release gates,
composing with `verify-with-xtask-verify`. Workspace 2,218/0, acceptance
20/20, architecture + naming-guard clean, seed count 95==95. Honest
limitation: report-compliance effectiveness of installed agents is not
yet measured by any eval.

## Advanced context paging — full implementation audit (PR-1..PR-5) — 2026-09-12

`context-paging-full-audit.md` records the end-to-end audit: five findings,
all repaired with fail-then-pass regression proofs — F1 per-skill chunk
budget never decremented (reproduced 36,261 > 24,000), F2 SUMMARY_ONLY
overhead measured against the full text (published 16/16 parity was a
metric artifact; true 13–14 vs 16), F3 explicit requests with invalid
manifests failed silently, F4 manifest defects masking `archived`,
F5 the eval control case silently failing activation while the report
narrative claimed controls always succeed. **ADOPT verdict re-derived and
stands on corrected data.** Workspace 2,217/0 (+4 audit regressions),
acceptance 20/20, architecture + naming-guard clean. PR-4 report carries
an explicit audit-correction note.

## Advanced context paging — PR-5 (docs & authoring; initiative COMPLETE) — 2026-09-12

`context-paging-pr5-execution.md` closes the five-PR initiative: chunk
authoring guidance in `skills/AGENTS.md` + `vesper-skill-authoring` v1.1.0
(seed mirrored to the global home, byte-identical), matching shipped
behavior exactly (32/24,000 caps, ≤3 loaded, summary/key_elements actively
routing post-ADOPT, fail-closed semantics, vocabulary-competition
pitfall). Explicit no-user-surface finding (zero `apps/` changes).
migration-status row → COMPLETE. Floors intact: workspace 2,213/0,
acceptance 20/20, naming-guard clean, seed count 94. Initiative-level
open items (CI matrix, chunked seed exemplar, alias cross-talk remedy)
recorded in §7 of the report.

## Advanced context paging — PR-4 (D3 eval gate; verdict ADOPT) — 2026-09-12

`context-paging-pr4-eval.md` records the D3 decision: strict
three-condition ablation (FLAT_DESCRIPTION / SUMMARY_ONLY /
SUMMARY_KEY_ELEMENTS) over a 2-family × 2-probe corpus in
`crates/vesper-memory/tests/chunk_routing_eval.rs`, entirely offline.
Improvement repeated across BOTH families with distinct marginal-value
carriers; measured overhead 13–14 (SUMMARY_ONLY) / 16 (SUMMARY_KEY_ELEMENTS)
semantic tokens/skill (audit-corrected); zero regression on
controls. Verdict ADOPT; `CHUNK_METADATA_ROUTING_ENABLED = true` flipped
in the same change. Material finding: production `SEMANTIC_ALIASES`
cross-talk (`deploy → release`) can outvote honest key-elements matches —
corpus hardened, production remedy deferred with its own evidence bar.
Workspace 2,213/0, acceptance 20/20, architecture + naming-guard clean.

## Advanced context paging — PR-3 (composition & injection) — 2026-09-12

`context-paging-pr3-execution.md` owns the PR-3 execution record: chunk
payloads moved onto `LoadedSkill`, named
`<agent-vesper-skill-chunk>` emission in `context()` after the primary
slice, transient host-append/restore (AC-3), and direct/VRO/ReAct
seam-parity proofs in `crates/vesper-harness/tests/context_paging_composition.rs`
(6 tests, real AgentLoop + FakeProviderSession capture). Material
architecture finding: `vesper-agent` is deliberately skill-unaware and the
architecture gate caught a `vesper-agent → vesper-memory` dev-dep edge —
tests correctly relocated to the harness composition boundary. Workspace
2,208/0, acceptance 20/20, architecture 27 packages, naming-guard clean.

## Advanced context paging — PR-2 (two-level routing) — 2026-09-12

`context-paging-pr2-execution.md` owns the PR-2 execution record:
bounded second-pass chunk routing (`MAX_CHUNKS_PER_SELECTION = 3`,
description-only feed while `CHUNK_METADATA_ROUTING_ENABLED = false`),
chunks counted against per-skill/total budgets with fail-closed skip
(never truncated), isolated skills excluded, and all four AC-2 proof
categories in `tests/skill_routing.rs` — including the distinguishing
budget-boundary case (chunk under the byte cap but over the per-skill
allowance → rejected *by budget*) and the flag-off neutrality proof
(summary-only overlap loads nothing). Workspace 2,202/0, acceptance
20/20, architecture + naming-guard clean. Deviations (compile-time flag,
envelope emission deferred to PR-3) and open items recorded.

## Advanced context paging — PR-1 (storage & manifest) — 2026-09-12

`context-paging-pr1-execution.md` owns the PR-1 execution record: chunk
storage enumeration, manifest parse, fail-closed caps (32 chunks / 24,000
bytes, field caps), G5 zero-regression proofs, and the exact gate receipts
(workspace 2,197/0 vs the 2,185+ floor, `cargo xtask acceptance` 20/20,
architecture 27 packages, naming-guard clean). Includes a live sabotage-run
note: a fixture path mistake made three tests fail with the exact
fail-closed rejection, proving the manifest-vs-disk gate bites. Deviations
(chunk-dir layout matching `references/` convention, added field caps) and
open items (`MAX_CHUNKS_PER_SELECTION` for PR-2, D2 routing-neutrality,
CI pending) are recorded. Scope: PRD PR-1/AC-1 only; routing, composition,
and eval remain future PRs.

## Completion assurance research — 2026-09-11

`completion-assurance-proposal.md` records source inspection at `8083f9f`,
primary-source open-source research, and a proposed Rust completion gate.
The inspected loop accepts model-updated plan completion without a requirement
evidence verdict; streamed content can precede the terminal decision. The proposal
separates coverage review, observed verification, and permission to claim completion.
Status: research/design only; no runtime implementation, dependency installation,
provider experiment, release, or measured effectiveness claim.

## VRO-15 asynchronous lease and contained native Hive checkpoint

- `vro15-repair-execution.md` owns the current F01–F18 matrix and exact resume
  point. Reservation/dispatch/commit moves all backend lease operations outside
  bookkeeping locks, retains cancelled/hung ownership, and exposes explicit
  cleanup outcomes. The native factory now binds scoped routes across command
  continuations, scale, retirement and replacement.
- Real Podman testing reproduced SELinux mount and stop-grace defects, then passed
  after explicit private worker-root labels and bounded ephemeral stop semantics.
  All four topologies pass real 1+3-worker commands, approvals, synthesis,
  scale/replacement, post-replacement execution and clean shutdown. The same-image
  x86_64/ARM64 CI gate is wired; CI execution remains pending.
- Canonical and Rust 1.88 full workspace: **2,049/0/25**; default: **2,006/0/17**.
  Strict Clippy, formatting, architecture, naming, supply chain and whitespace pass.
  Explicit real pipe-browser, Chrome interview and both bounded ledger scale bodies
  pass. Namespace admission remains blocked by `/proc/self/uid_map` permission
  denial, including an authorized outside-sandbox attempt.
- Full VRO-15 is **not complete**: persisted native Settings, both-host command/
  execution composition, project-input delivery, cognition/compaction, full Lens
  continuation, timestamp/high-dimensional/property work and external gates remain.
  This checkpoint does not authorize activation or a release.

## VRO-15 lease-port unwind containment

- Acquire/release/retry panics close admission without poisoning lease bookkeeping;
  uncertain boundaries remain reserved and queued callers wake closed. Two tests
  cover partial creation, cleanup/retry panic and holder unwind.
- Swarm suite: **269 passed, 0 failed, 3 ignored**. Package strict Clippy, Rust 1.88
  locked check, architecture, naming, workspace formatting and whitespace pass.
  Subsequent all-feature workspace suite: **2,036 passed, 0 failed, 23 ignored**.
  Async composition and blocking/supervisor acceptance remain open; see
  `vro15-repair-execution.md` for exact evidence and limitations.

## VRO-15 shared sandbox panic containment

- The shared command adapter converts backend construction/poll unwind into
  quarantine and refusal; a run panic still reaches explicit teardown. Three new
  tests cover provision panics, phase guards and ordinary refusal behavior.
- All-feature harness suite: **101 passed, 0 failed, 0 ignored**. Package strict
  Clippy, Rust 1.88 locked check, architecture, naming, workspace formatting and
  whitespace checks pass. No full-workspace or supervisor acceptance claim.
- Async lease composition, blocking hangs and native activation remain open;
  exact scope and panic-hook limitations are in `vro15-repair-execution.md`.

## VRO-15 Hive membership reconciliation checkpoint

- `vro15-repair-execution.md` records caller-owned pool scaling/health replacement
  wired to concrete routes, topology, inboxes and assignment loads, with fail-closed
  cancellation/reconciliation behavior and navigator failover policy preserved.
- Five regressions pass; workspace all-feature suite: 2,004 passed, 23 ignored.
  Strict Clippy, MSRV compilation, architecture, naming, format and whitespace pass.
- Native monitoring, supervisor cleanup, Settings/host and browser-to-provider Lens
  integration remain open. This is library lifecycle evidence, not full acceptance.

## VRO-15 retirement and generation-cost checkpoint

- `vro15-repair-execution.md` records four reproduced retirement defects repaired
  and graph/entry structural sharing with preserved immutable reader generations.
- Explicit 10k/16D release workload improved from 27.667 s to 1.618 s locally;
  lossless snapshot/continued insertion and 1k bounded retention checks pass.
  These measurements do not certify million-entry memory or native-host latency.
- Workspace: 1,999 passed, 23 ignored; both newly ignored scale measurements were
  separately executed successfully. Strict Clippy, MSRV, architecture, naming,
  formatting and whitespace checks pass. Full swarm/host acceptance remains open.

## VRO-15 interview adapter-boundary checkpoint

- `vro15-repair-execution.md` records matching GLM and native OpenAI serialization
  fixtures; OpenAI covers both auth modes, decoded call identity and next-request
  notes/answers. No production adapter behavior changed. Browser/host end-to-end
  delivery and original HTTP 400 diagnosis remain open.
- Latest all-feature workspace suite: 1,994 passed, 21 ignored. OpenAI: 37 passed;
  GLM provider verification: 59 passed. Workspace strict Clippy, MSRV compilation,
  architecture, naming, formatting and whitespace checks pass locally.

## VRO-15 automatic retention checkpoint

- `vro15-repair-execution.md` records persisted per-scope admission caps, atomic
  record/transfer reservation and version-2 whole-ledger policy validation.
- Four new regressions pass. Latest local verification: 1,992 all-feature workspace
  tests passed, 21 ignored; 246 swarm tests passed, 1 ignored. Workspace Clippy,
  Rust 1.88 compilation, formatting, architecture, naming and whitespace checks pass.
- Scale, lifecycle/cleanup, host composition and Lens/provider-wire acceptance
  remain open; this checkpoint is not full repair or cross-platform acceptance.

## VRO-15 ledger retrieval and retention checkpoint

- `vro15-repair-execution.md` records eight new tests for provenance/category/range
  filters, transactional selective transfer, explicit per-scope retention, semantic
  threshold and configured over-fetch. Immutable reader generations are preserved.
- Latest local verification: 1,988 workspace all-feature tests passed, 21 ignored;
  242 swarm tests passed, 1 ignored. Workspace Clippy, Rust 1.88 locked compilation,
  formatting, architecture, naming and whitespace checks pass.
- Automatic retention/scale, lifecycle/cleanup, Settings/host activation and Lens
  provider-wire acceptance remain open. This is not full swarm or release acceptance.

## VRO-15 native OpenAI rejection diagnostics

- `vro15-repair-execution.md` records bounded, allowlisted rejection diagnostics:
  36 adapter tests, 4 existing native ACP tests, 1 new both-mode ACP rejection test,
  39 Lens tests and 2 TUI native OpenAI wiring tests pass locally.
- Real ACP protocol error data preserves `ContextLimit` without raw provider prose.
  Original HTTP 400 cause, Lens provider-wire delivery and full swarm acceptance
  remain unresolved. Focused checks are not new full-workspace/platform evidence.

## VRO-15 local verification checkpoint

- All-feature workspace recheck: 1,947 passed, 21 ignored; Clippy, Rust 1.88
  compilation, formatting, architecture, naming and whitespace checks pass.
- The prior run had an intermittent web-driver detection fixture failure; focused
  and full reruns passed. See `vro15-repair-execution.md` for the exact limitation.
- This is local partial-repair evidence, not F01–F18 or cross-platform acceptance.

## VRO-15 repair milestone: native AgentLoop adapter

- `vro15-repair-execution.md` records replacement of the stream-only adapter with
  the existing native AgentLoop, real tool transactions, executable role filtering,
  inherited permission/configuration ports and retained interrupted history.
- Six default-off adapter tests pass. Both host DOX documents retain activation
  as open work and remove the unsupported ACP progress exclusion.
- Caller-time bus expiry and pool capacity/timing ceilings have focused acceptance;
  independent worker lifecycle, overlap and full cross-host acceptance remain open.

## VRO-15 repair milestone: lifecycle and execution boundaries

- `vro15-repair-execution.md` records partition failover persistence, actual pool
  cancellation, bounded snapshot serialization, strict structured decomposition,
  scored class routing, retained interrupted goals and grounded synthesis.
- Regression tests cover each changed contract; real independent-worker overlap,
  native host composition and provider-wire feedback remain open acceptance work.
- Cargo metadata architecture checks now enforce optional/default-off swarm edges,
  with unconditional, transitive-default and renamed bypass tests.

## VRO-15 repair milestone: centralized leader wiring

- `vro15-repair-execution.md` records failed-before/passed-after hub-vacancy
  evidence and manual/automatic failover regression coverage.
- Swarm and all-feature workspace tests, crate all-target Clippy, architecture,
  naming guard and whitespace checks pass locally. Partition lifecycle and full
  F01–F18 acceptance remain open; this is not a release-readiness claim.

## VRO-15 repair milestone: assignment scoring

- `vro15-repair-execution.md` records partial repair evidence, not full acceptance.
- Whole-base health scaling and hard candidate eligibility corrected in
  `crates/vesper-swarm/src/hive/assignment.rs`; four desired-behavior regression
  tests added. Hive dispatch integration remains open.
- Local `cargo test -p vesper-swarm`: 167 pass, one ignored doctest.
  Crate all-target clippy (`-D warnings`), architecture, naming guard and diff
  whitespace checks pass. Workspace/MSRV/platform acceptance remains pending.
- VesperLens provider coupling remains an unconfirmed hypothesis.

## VRO-15 repair milestone: cancellation, pool, leases and bus

- See `vro15-repair-execution.md` for scoped acceptance and remaining gaps.
- Timeout signal propagation/caller-drop checks pass. Nine new integration
  regressions across pool, leases and bus failed before fixes and pass afterward.
- Local swarm suite: 176 pass, one ignored doctest; crate all-target Clippy,
  all-feature workspace compilation, architecture, naming guard and whitespace
  checks pass. This is not full workspace test/MSRV/platform or host acceptance.

## VRO-15 repair milestone: HNSW loader hardening

- `vro15-repair-execution.md` records input-budget, identity/edge/layer, finite
  vector and caller-policy validation. Four new loader regressions, 13 existing
  HNSW integrations and crate Clippy pass. RNG/config/raw-vector persistence,
  math/pruning and full snapshot acceptance remain open.

## VRO-15 topology and snapshot publication milestone

- See `vro15-repair-execution.md`: topology vacancy/successor/refusal fixes,
  HNSW v2 raw/RNG/config persistence and math repair, immutable ledger generations,
  transactional transfer, and whole-ledger snapshot format.
- Local 190 swarm tests pass, one doctest ignored; crate Clippy, Rust 1.88 locked
  crate check, all-feature workspace compilation, architecture and naming guard
  pass. Pinned `cargo-deny 0.20.2` in a temporary tool root passes advisory,
  ban, license and source gates with all features.
- Full F01–F18, partition lifecycle, resource/scale, hosts, and VesperLens
  acceptance remain open. This milestone is not full completion.

## VesperLens interview verdict clarification

- `vro15-repair-execution.md`: separate typed planning-answer action, preserved
  notes/choices through JSON and authenticated loopback delivery; 54 Lens tests
  and agent Clippy pass. Both real-Chrome E2E scripts pass using temporary,
  verified Node tooling and Playwright. Workspace: 1,922 tests pass (21 ignored),
  full Clippy, Rust 1.88 all-feature compilation, formatting, architecture and
  naming checks pass. OpenAI-specific loss is not reproduced; provider-wire and
  ACP browser integration remain open acceptance gaps.

## Bus resource bounds milestone

- `vro15-repair-execution.md`: payload/aggregate bytes, subscriber/identity,
  TTL/count and ACK-debt ceilings; four new bounded-resource regressions and
  28 existing bus tests pass. Explicit time composition remains open.

## VRO-14 production completion acceptance — 2026-09-07

- Baseline `v0.20.88` / `9ff4695b`; requirement-to-source map and exact
  commands/results: `vro14-gap-audit.md`.
- Implemented real contained pipe-CDP sessions, render waterfall, bounded
  sitemap/gzip discovery, shared engine configuration and pinned driver build.
- Canonical verification passed; MSRV 1.88: 1,673 passed, 0 failed, 20 ignored
  across 87 suites; both unchanged release-profile performance gates passed.
- Immutable-image real browser and explicit navigation/chunked-fetch tests
  passed on Linux x86_64; no provider calls or user-state writes; post-test
  container enumeration empty. Two native image CI jobs gate public assets.
- DOX pass updated web/config/harness/sandbox, fixture, workflow and owning
  documentation contracts. Version-only crate contracts remain unchanged.
- Released `v0.20.89` at `5658da6eefa8a13042e938eaedccfdb7a1537ad5` after
  exact-commit canonical/supply-chain, MSRV, five-target and both driver-image
  jobs passed. Release run `34072500086` passed; all 16 public assets and seven
  archive digests verified, Linux binary version smoke passed, and the exact
  published x86_64 image passed both real-browser tests. Registry PR #539
  updated in place at fork commit `4f62da58cc37d6c77425218cc80fdc49db26f920`.

## VRO-15 independent acceptance audit — f662519

- `vro15-gap-audit.md` rejects the full-completion claim for implementation
  `fb14ea2`: 18 grouped findings with source evidence and proposed repairs.
  Production fixes await Alex's approval; default-off behavior remains unchanged.
- Reproduced workspace floors: 1,893 all-features / 1,869 default, zero failures.
  Actual swarm suite: 163 passing tests (also on Rust 1.88), not the ADR's 171.
- `vro15-audit-probes.rs`: 16 standalone probes reproduce defects in cancellation,
  pool bounds/replacement, topology failover, sandbox sharing/teardown, bus lifecycle
  and HNSW loading/determinism. Passing these probes confirms defects, not acceptance.
- Architecture, naming guard, workspace formatting and swarm Clippy pass. Full
  canonical/supply-chain/target-matrix acceptance is not certified by this audit.
- Treat the following original closeout as historical claims, not current acceptance.

## VRO-15 original closeout claims — 2026-09-10

- The original closeout described `vesper-swarm` as delivered in ten PRs (scaffold+guard, topology
  manager, worker pool, priority bus, assignment/timeout, HNSW core,
  hybrid ledger, sandbox leases, hive orchestrator + adapter,
  documentation closeout); decision record is
  `docs/adr/0025-provider-neutral-swarm-orchestration.md`, requirements
  and per-PR evidence live in `docs/swarm-oracle-extraction-prd.md`.
- Measured floors at close: **1,893 passed / 0 failed**
  (`cargo test --workspace --all-features`) and **1,869 / 0** (default
  features — the zero-degradation proof; the default build links no
  swarm symbols). Monotonic ladder across PRs: 1,741 → 1,767 → 1,785 →
  1,813 → 1,832 → 1,853 → 1,868 → 1,881 → 1,893; no test deleted or
  weakened.
- Quality bars with executable evidence: HNSW Recall@10 = 0.997 @ ef=16
  and 1.000 @ ef≥64 against brute-force cosine on 10k seeded vectors
  (`crates/vesper-swarm/tests/hnsw_tests.rs`); sandbox teardown survives
  holder panics with exact acquire/release pairing
  (`crates/vesper-swarm/tests/sandbox_tests.rs`); the naming embargo is
  a CI ratchet (`cargo xtask naming-guard`,
  `xtask/naming-guard-baseline.json`: 30 frozen pre-existing hits,
  0 new).
- `cargo xtask architecture` validates the feature-gated edges
  (`vesper-harness → vesper-provider/vesper-swarm` as optional deps
  only); `cargo xtask verify` runs the naming guard in CI.

## Outstanding acceptance

- Registry PR #539 awaits upstream review; the v0.20.89 release and web
  implementation acceptance are complete (`vro14-gap-audit.md`).

- Historical executor-stall cause is not reconstructable, but the complete source baseline is green and repeatable.
- Product approvals listed in `decision-register.md` and `blocker-closure-report.md`.
- ACP `PromptResponse.userMessageId` compatibility-wrapper detail during Stage 1.
- Linux ARM64, macOS Intel/Apple Silicon, and Windows x86-64 workflow execution.

## VRO-15 concurrent dispatch and embedding boundaries

- `crates/vesper-swarm/tests/hive_concurrency_regressions.rs`: three-party barrier
  overlap, prerequisite ordering, sibling cancellation and aliased-port capacity.
- `hive_boundary_regressions.rs`: hanging embedding is bounded, publishes nothing,
  retains the interrupted goal and refuses replay.
- Source/limits: `vro15-repair-execution.md`, concurrent-dispatch milestone.
  Native host, worker factory and lease/health acceptance are not implied.

## VRO-15 lease resource bounds

- `sandbox_tests.rs`: specification/timeout/boundary bounds refuse before backend
  work; 4,096 waiter overflow leaves state unchanged; dropped waiters reclaim the
  queue; shared joins cannot bypass 4,096 global members.
- `sandbox.rs` also bounds retained diagnostic bytes and guards identity exhaustion.
  Synchronous port preemption and real supervisor lifecycle acceptance remain open.

## VRO-15 local verification after concurrent waves and lease bounds

- `cargo test --workspace --all-features`: **1,954 passed, 0 failed, 21 ignored**.
- Workspace all-target/all-feature Clippy and Rust 1.88 locked compilation,
  formatting, architecture, naming and whitespace checks pass.
- Seven added regressions; feature remains default-off. Independent pool creation,
  supervisor/host integration and final audit acceptance remain explicitly open.

## VRO-15 independent factory milestone

- `pool_instance_regressions.rs`: seven passing tests for independent boot/turn
  overlap, growth/replacement/shrink, rollback, timeout/close/drop cancellation,
  alias refusal and failed-lease quarantine.
- `swarm_adapter_tests.rs`: seven passing adapter tests including native factory
  pooling followed by real tool execution and provider continuation.
- Hive per-instance lifecycle/lease/health wiring and host acceptance remain open;
  see `vro15-repair-execution.md`. No full F01/F07 completion claim is made.

## VRO-15 factory verification checkpoint

- Workspace all-feature tests: **1,962 passed, 0 failed, 21 ignored**.
- All-target/all-feature Clippy and Rust 1.88 locked compilation, formatting,
  architecture, naming guard and whitespace checks pass.
- Replacement physical-resource teardown remains a lease-composition gap;
  transactional pool publication does not prove supervisor capacity bounds.

## VRO-15 exact selected-lease execution

- `pool_selected_lease_regressions.rs`: three passing tests for exact selected
  identity, foreign/failed lease refusal and capability/deadline rejection.
- `run_task` and `run_leased_task` share the same execution boundary. Hive still
  needs concrete pool worker routing/provenance and lease/health/shutdown wiring.

- Selected-lease checkpoint: workspace **1,965 passed, 0 failed, 21 ignored**;
  all-target/all-feature Clippy and Rust 1.88 locked compilation, formatting,
  architecture, naming and whitespace checks pass. Full acceptance remains open.

## VRO-15 directed dispatch, bus correlation and source-captured scorer

- Disconnected dispatch and identical-prompt bus substitution regressions failed
  before repair. Candidate routing now follows live directed topology paths from
  the elected navigator; dispatch checks its exact message ID and concrete peers.
  Native three-session tool/synthesis integration still passes all four topologies.
- Seventy-two scoring outputs captured from the pinned oracle method match Rust;
  commit, method hash, type-match mapping and capture recipe are recorded in
  `vro15-repair-execution.md`. Oracle checkout remains unchanged and clean.
- Final canonical and Rust 1.88 workspace: **2,031/0/23**; default **1,994/0/17**.
  Scoped asynchronous leases, native Settings/hosts and external isolation/target
  acceptance remain open; no activation claim changes.

## VRO-15 backend teardown, identity and governance continuation

- Two backend regressions reproduced false-success teardown; explicit namespace/
  Docker cleanup now reports ownership, status and reaping failures. Post-deadline
  reaping is polled for at most 500 ms. Actual isolation remains platform-gated.
- Three lease identity regressions reproduced duplicate active/queued/quarantined
  admission; typed refusal now precedes backend/queue mutation.
- Strict counted JSON naming baseline preserves all 30 HEAD-frozen exceptions;
  four self-tests enforce stable line shifts without permitting new duplicates.
  ADR 0026 supersedes original completion/adapter/ACP-exclusion claims; current
  migration and PRD status correctly retain default-off repair status.
- ETXTBSY fixture failure reproduced; immutable checked-in CLI with isolated state
  replaces runtime-written executables. Twenty repeated fixture suites pass.
- Canonical and Rust 1.88 full workspace **2,027/0/23**, default **1,990/0/17**.
  Six namespace test bodies skip locally; three Docker integration tests are ignored.
  Detailed methods/limits and remaining acceptance: `vro15-repair-execution.md`.

## VRO-15 native composition and shared sandbox outcome acceptance

- Shared TUI/ACP sandbox adapter now reports teardown failure, retains run
  diagnostics and quarantines subsequent provisioning. Six outcome/refusal unit
  tests pass; actual supervisor failure/panic/hang acceptance remains open.
- Native Hive integration covers three barrier-overlapping isolated provider
  sessions, real read-file tool continuations, evidence-fed synthesis and no
  implicit durable state under all four topology configurations.
- Canonical offline verification and full Rust 1.88 tests pass **2,016/0/23**;
  default workspace **1,981/0/17**. Supply-chain gates and real Chrome interview
  browser test pass. One earlier MSRV driver-fixture spawn failure did not recur;
  OS diagnostics improved but its root cause remains unproven.
- `vro15-repair-execution.md` now contains the current F01–F18 reconciliation,
  exact acceptance limits and remaining native host/supervisor/platform work.
  Full repair is still in progress; activation remains default-off.

## VRO-15 explicit quarantine recovery

- `LeaseBook::retry_quarantined` adds bounded caller-owned cleanup through an
  explicitly supported idempotent backend port; unsupported/failed attempts keep
  capacity quarantined. Three offline regressions cover handoff, accounting,
  shared names, budgets and closed-book recovery.
- Package verification: **260 passed, 0 failed, 3 ignored**; strict package
  Clippy, Rust 1.88 locked all-target check, architecture, naming and whitespace
  checks pass. Native supervisor cleanup and host activation remain unaccepted;
  details and limitations are in `vro15-repair-execution.md`.

## VRO-15 concrete Hive pool routing

- Six `hive_pool_regressions.rs` tests: actual 1+3 pool overlap and executing-ID
  provenance, cross-role alias refusal, nominal-slot refusal, actual cancellation,
  notification ordering and transactional/idempotent topology admission.
- `Hive::with_factories` uses concrete pool instances; `Hive::new` no longer
  fabricates several topology workers from a single supplied port.
- Health-driven lifecycle changes, verified leases/teardown and native host
  acceptance remain open; details are in `vro15-repair-execution.md`.

- Concrete Hive routing checkpoint: workspace **1,971 passed, 0 failed, 21 ignored**;
  all-target/all-feature Clippy and Rust 1.88 locked compilation, formatting,
  architecture, naming guard and whitespace checks pass. Native host/full audit
  acceptance remains open; activation stays default-off.

## VRO-15 native hosts and shared scopes (active working tree)

`vro15-repair-execution.md` records local ACP transport and TUI command/task/history
acceptance, real configured loopback embeddings, native tool continuations, both
scope modes, shared-container sibling confinement and descendant cleanup, original
timestamps, portable snapshots and repaired clustered HNSW recall. Canonical/MSRV each pass 2072 tests; default workspace passes 2015. All four
optimized scale tests and final audit/deny pass. External exact-commit target and
namespace gates remain separately tracked for v0.21.6; v0.21.5 CI does not certify
this implementation. The TUI fixture's rejected synthetic-key public
request is recorded explicitly and excluded from acceptance; corrected runs assert
the configured loopback endpoint before dispatch.


## VRO-15 exact-commit supervisor follow-up

Initial candidate CI exposed the post-unshare overflow-ID defect, rootful Docker
artifact ownership mismatch and noncanonical macOS/Windows fixture roots. The
repair ledger and ADR 0027 record fixes, including private-root confinement,
capability drops, bounded pipe/handshake waits and truthful nonzero shell exits.
Real local namespace Hive and the explicit security/timeout gate now pass, as does
shared Podman confinement and original-owner restoration. Candidate CI success
must be re-established on the final commit before tagging; no release was used to
discover these failures.


## VRO-15 final implementation and release evidence

The final F01–F18 matrix records completed implementation and local acceptance,
including the corrected namespace supervisor. Canonical/MSRV: 2072 passed, zero
failed, 34 explicit ignored bodies; default: 2015/0/20. The required real namespace
and shared-container gates execute separately. Candidate `e6476df` has successful
canonical, MSRV and both-architecture complete web-driver workflows; its Windows
platform interruption was an HTTP 500 cache download before tests. Optional cache
setup now reaches the existing direct-compilation fallback. Final publication still
requires all four successful push workflows on the exact release commit. The
v0.21.6 release notes own the final run links, image IDs and local-install receipt.

## Native completion assurance implementation — 2026-09-11

- Approved ADR 0028 and `completion-assurance-execution.md` own the native gate,
  adversarial/real-repair cases, exact-case CI and bounded mutation evidence.
- Final repository verification and release readiness are reported there;
  research references alone do not establish implementation completion.
- Final canonical verification and both native binary builds passed. All 20
  exact acceptance cases passed; both deliberate evaluator mutations were caught.
  Local implementation evidence does not imply a release or installed update.

## VRO-16 release v0.21.9 — 2026-09-12

- Tag `v0.21.9` at `0b4cd0d`. The first version commit `b790e4f` was
  rejected by the web-driver exact-commit gate: the native loopback
  providers scripted only pre-governance turn shapes, so the composed
  review-panel and decision turns failed inside the native
  shared-service/ACP/TUI gates. This is the exact-commit contract
  working as designed — the gap was invisible to local canonical gates
  because the native container/service fixtures run only in the
  web-driver workflow's environment.
- Repair: `TaskKind::Review` maps to an empty tool registry in the
  provider adapter (D3 — judges evaluate, never author/re-execute),
  native fixtures answer review and decision turns, count expectations
  updated, cancellation invariant made baseline-relative. All gates
  reproduced locally with the real CI-built driver image (podman) and
  the release supervisor before pushing the fix.
- Green on the exact commit before tagging: canonical, MSRV,
  five-target foundation, dual-architecture web-driver (run ids
  34674795540/34674795595/34674795554/34674795541). Release run
  34676270024 verified exact-commit CI and published 16 assets;
  checksums verified locally; installer upgrade preserves user state;
  registry PR #539 updated in place.

## VRO-16 advanced hive governance — 2026-09-12

- Requirements: `docs/advanced-hive-governance-prd.md` (PR-1 §2, PR-2 §3,
  PR-3 §4). Upstreams referenced exclusively as governance alpha/beta
  (recon `docs/architecture/recon_vro16_governance.md`, pinned commits).
- Final audit found nine integration gaps (G1–G9) between the tested
  engines and the composed production path — the VRO-15 decorative-layer
  failure mode. All were repaired in the same audit pass and each now has
  an executing proof in
  `crates/vesper-swarm/tests/hive_governance_audit_fixes.rs`.
- G2 gate bus publication is real: the `governor` inbox subscribes at
  topology admission (`MessageKind::Governance`, Urgent tier); gate sends
  fail loudly on publication failure; `drain_governance_bus` is the host
  observation seam.
- G3 ledger audit trail is complete: every gate resolution persists
  before its state effects (Cancel no longer drops its own audit record);
  `record_gate_event` derives the goal from the event, and the audit
  entry round-trips as an `AuditEvent` through `EntryKind::Audit`.
- G4 `governance: gated` enforces decomposition and synthesis boundary
  gates (once per task id per run — `resolved_gate_ids`).
- G5 Redirect directives reach re-dispatched worker prompts.
- G9 SmartPause consumes the real watchdog percentage
  (`BudgetWatchdog::percent_consumed`), not a constant.
- G1 the review panel composes pre-synthesis on governance-enabled hives
  (async round driver over driver ports; bare VRO-15 hives keep exact
  turn-count contracts; zero-panel fails closed).
- G6 budget exhaustion renders in both hosts; G7 the directive rides
  `GateResolved.command` (PRD D4 amended instead of a redundant variant);
  G8 this entry.
- **G4 re-audit (same day, prompted by direct owner challenge):** the
  boundary-gate fix above was itself incomplete — gates opened but did
  not pause the gated work (the decomposition gate fell through to task
  dispatch in the same tick; the synthesis gate ran panel+synthesis
  anyway), the G4 proof asserted only gate *views*, not held-back work,
  and `run_to_completion` could hot-loop on an unresolvable open gate.
  All three repaired: both boundaries now park the run (`Ok(false)`,
  `active_goal` cleared, assignments/evidence retained) and resume after
  host resolution or expiry; `run_to_completion` returns instead of
  spinning when a gate is open; the proof is behavior-based — zero task
  prompts reach drivers while the decomposition gate is open, synthesis
  is held until its gate resolves, the goal completes after both
  resolutions, and the spin-safety case asserts the run stays parked.
  Lesson recorded: a gate that does not stop anything is not a gate, and
  proving "the gate exists" is not proving "the gate gates."
- Final verification: workspace all-features and default suites, strict
  Clippy, fmt, architecture (27 packages), naming-guard (11 tokens, 18
  frozen hits, zero growth), `cargo xtask acceptance` 20/20. Counts in
  `docs/migration-status.md` VRO-16 row.

- `v0.22.1-release-execution.md` — exact-commit release of the A1 audit fix: 4 workflows green on 1b221dc, tag v0.22.1, 16 assets, binary 0.22.1, registry PR #539 head 8138e28, local install updated (both binaries 0.22.1).
- `ranker-hardening-final-audit.md` — cross-PR audit: scope fence verified (2-line diff), pin sabotage-verified bidirectionally, A1 latent metric defect found+fixed (overhead tokenizer vs ranker pool; shipped numbers unaffected), M2 re-derived, release evidence reconciled.
- `ranker-hardening-pr3-execution.md` — stop rule clean (canonical table + overheads identical under the hardened ranker; verdict re-derived ADOPT); v0.22.0 released per the exact-commit contract (4 workflows green on 9b56a9e; tag; 16 assets; binary 0.22.0; registry PR #539 updated in place).
- `ranker-hardening-pr2-execution.md` — Option A decoupling: chunk pools raw-stemmed (`raw_semantic_tokens`), prompt pool keeps expansion; pin green, control green, D3 ladder green, skill tier frozen, floor 2,220.
- `chunk-score-floor-pr1-execution.md` — noise anchor: offline-exact ranker replication found a 1,440-pt pure-cosine disjoint pair (0.6547, zero overlap, no name-match); pin test fails on the unhardened tree with receipt, `#[ignore]`d until PR-2; genuine-overlap control green (+1 floor test, 2,253); clippy 0, acceptance 23/23, naming-guard clean. (Self-caught write_file-replaces-instead-of-appends near-miss recorded in §5.)
- `chunk-score-floor-prd-execution.md` — PRD for the chunk-tier cosine noise floor: conjunction gate `(overlap>=1 || name_match) && score>=520` in `rank_chunks` (bare 520 floor rejected — observed 678-pt noise outlier passes it; sensitivity table in PRD §1.1); 3-PR anchor-first plan; G5 literal restoration in PR-3. DOX updated (AGENTS.md bullet, migration-status PLANNING).
- `exemplar-migration-execution.md` — first native chunked skill: `research-paper-writing` 74,109 → 10,228 B lean body + 16 chunks (67,426 B, max 11,125); Stage D proofs as real tests (16/16 routing-first, budget ≤24 K, G5 with recorded hash-noise finding: zero-overlap prompts can still route ≤3 chunks on positive signed-hash cosine — floor-remediation flagged for a future PRD); floor 2,252, acceptance 23/23, clippy 0, naming-guard clean; global mirror synced.
- `recon-exemplar-candidate-execution.md` — exemplar hunt (read-only): `research-paper-writing` selected (74,109 B / 27 sections / body 3.1× the 24 K injection cap — 20 of 27 sections never injected; ~1.3 MB shadow reference layer); 16-chunk blueprint, lean ~6.1 KB body, worst-case activation ~19 KB.
- `ranker-hardening-pr1-execution.md` — Option D anchor: cross-talk pin fails for the audited reason (rollback displaces migrate via 1,560-pt manufactured overlap); no-alias control green; floor 2,219; `#[ignore]` until PR-2.

- [Routing request recognition](skill-routing-request-recognition-execution.md): ongoing sourced-verb and topic-evidence experiments; retains negative-activation regressions and pending independent evaluation.

- [v0.22.6 release execution](v0.22.6-release-execution.md) — voice controls, long dictation and exact-commit publication.

[Increment 37 — v0.23.1 PUBLISHED](../foundation/v0.23.1-release-final.md): Bridge shipped experimental/default-off on 5 platforms (14 checksummed artifacts); one registry-manifest gate failure caught + fixed + re-tagged; registry PR #539 updated in place per continuous-update contract. Live: github.com/99percentgrip/agent-vesper/releases/tag/v0.23.1
[Increment 38 — v0.23.3: Bridge actually IN the binaries + native Settings activation](v0.23.3-release-execution.md): v0.23.1 artifacts contained ZERO Bridge code (release.yml built only docker,swarm); release matrix now compiles bridge into both hosts (byte-grep receipts). Native activation: TUI `/settings → Bridge` panel + ACP `/settings bridge` text controls (BR-21 parity); `/bridge` disabled text points to Settings, never hand-edited JSON. Found + fixed a VACUOUS AT-01 pass: the old assertion matched the JSON snippet embedded in the disabled message; child cwd now pinned to the isolated root. Gates: fmt/clippy(both toolchains)/arch 28/naming 33/acceptance 23/23; suites harness 155+122, ACP 84+83, TUI 395, bridge 78 — all 0 failed.

## MCP conversation lifecycle repair

- [Execution report](mcp-session-lifecycle-repair.md): conversation-owned stdio,
  fault quarantine, host gateway wiring and isolated real-browser acceptance.
  Source repair only; installed-binary and cross-platform acceptance remain separate.
