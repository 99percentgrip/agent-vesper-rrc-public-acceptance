# vesper-memory — persistent memory and bounded awareness

## Purpose

Own the provider-neutral **durable memory graph** (ADR 0011 — Stage 12):
project-local memory entries, learned skills, the cross-project user
profile, and the bounded in-process epistemic ledger. This is the
subsystem that backs the Tier C Phase 8 un-stubbed commands
(`/memory`, `/goal`, `/skills`, `/profile`, `/awareness`, `/deliberation`,
`/metacognition`, `/repository`, `/meta-learning`, `/observability`,
`/subgoal`, `/curator`, `/journey`).

## Ownership

- `src/lib.rs` — public re-exports and crate-level docs.
- `src/store.rs` — `MemoryStore` (append-only JSONL memory entries) with
  atomic write-to-temp + rename, mirroring the `vesper-sessions` writer.
- `src/skills.rs` — `SkillStore` (markdown skill files under
  `<root>/skills/<slug>.md`), `SkillSummary`, and bounded JSON skill bundles
  under `<root>/bundles/<slug>.json`.
- `src/skill_orchestrator.rs` — ADR 0024 deterministic skill metadata parser,
  eligibility gate, semantic/file/trigger ranker, bounded composer, transient
  loader, and secret-free in-process outcome tracker.
- `src/routing_quality.rs` — bounded descriptor validation, metadata BM25 retrieval,
  typed action/artifact/effect/resource comparison, preview choices and traces.
  Enhanced lookup normalizes English word forms with the shared pinned
  `rust-stemmers` dependency and a bounded general task-vocabulary map; these
  transforms never run in Standard or the chunk tier. Single-term activation
  requires a meaningful metadata anchor and a task-request form. Descriptor
  validation does not rebuild per-entry indexes on the warm path.
  Embedded WordNet verb data recognizes request forms; a generic request verb
  alone is not topic evidence for a document. Contracts retain the full query.
  `skills.rs` owns optional sibling `.routing.json` reads and an in-memory index
  cache keyed by the current eligible catalog, source freshness stamps and descriptors.
  No routing operation writes skill sources or creates durable index state.
  `orchestrate_with_options` preserves Standard as default and reuses the existing
  conflict/body/chunk loader; offline ablation seams are not native controls.
- `src/model_routing.rs` owns bounded metadata selection offers and strict model
  decisions. Offers bind the task, current policy and source revisions; no body is
  loaded on the model-selected path before a decision passes fresh eligibility
  and snapshot checks. Explicitly reported lexical fallback remains available for
  oversized input or provider/parse failure. Snapshots bind store roots and bounded
  catalog freshness, not cryptographic full-body/chunk attestations; existing loaders
  validate current selected bodies/chunks and limits. Chunk ranking stays unchanged. The
  model never becomes explicit user invocation or permission authority.
- `src/profile.rs` — `UserProfile` (single markdown file with bounded
  size, append/forget with category sections).
- `src/awareness.rs` — `AwarenessLedger` and the `EpistemicRecord` /
  `EvidenceEvent` / `RecordKind` value types (bounded, in-process,
  JSON-serializable).
- `src/error.rs` — `MemoryError` (sanitized; never leaks paths or
  payloads that may carry secrets).

## Local Contracts

- Depends only on `vesper-domain` and `vesper-security`. No provider,
  runtime, ACP, sessions, agent, testkit, SQLite, HTTP, or TUI dependency.
- All filesystem writes are atomic (write-to-temp + `fsync` + rename),
  confined to the absolute root passed at construction, and bounded by
  configured byte limits. Refuses a non-absolute root or a root whose
  parent does not exist (same confinement rule as the Stage 6 writer).
- Stores never create the root directory; the composition boundary
  (binary) is responsible for ensuring it exists.
- No live provider calls, no network I/O, no subprocess execution.
- All public types are `Send + Sync` and use interior locking; the
  composition boundary can share one `Arc<MemoryStore>` across the
  TUI event loop and (future) the agent loop.
- Records are bounded: summary ≤ 1024 chars, scope list ≤ 8 entries,
  evidence list ≤ 16 entries, total entries ≤ 10_000. Inputs that
  exceed bounds are rejected, not silently truncated.
- Skill bundles are validated before atomic replacement: at most 32
  validated skill slugs and 32 KiB serialized JSON per bundle.
- Learned-skill files are bounded: the store enumerates at most 500
  skill files and each body is at most 200 KB (raised 2026-08 so
  migrated curated reference skills round-trip through `learn_skill`).
- `SkillStore` has an optional cross-project global read layer
  (`open_with_global`): listings append global-only skills after local
  ones, local slugs shadow, reads fall back, and writes/bundles-merges
  follow the same precedence. The TUI roots it at
  `AGENT_VESPER_GLOBAL_MEMORY_ROOT` (default `~/.agent-vesper/memory`);
  a missing root silently disables the layer.
- `read_section` extracts one heading's section; the headline shown by
  `list_skills` prefers the frontmatter `description` (oracle context
  parity: `- {name}: {description}`).
- Skill orchestration considers metadata only, selects at most three skills,
  and fails closed on invocation policy, archive/platform/tool/exclusion/
  conflict constraints. Inline bodies are bounded to 24,000 characters each
  and 60,000 total; isolated bodies are never returned to the main context.
  Selection and bundle activation never grant tool or external-side-effect
  permission.
- Explicit textual invocation uses one shared bounded parser for preliminary
  detection and final orchestration. `use skill <name>`, `with skill <name>`, and
  `use the <name> skill` accept one validated identifier token (case-insensitive,
  `_` compatibility alias for `-`, at most 64 characters); the natural marker is
  singular and whole-word in the same local construction. Parsing continues after
  rejected prose so a later valid directive remains reachable. Paths, sentence/
  paragraph/list spans, `skills`, `skillset`, and `skillful` remain ordinary text.
- Dollar shorthand activates only a complete installed skill name, parsed before
  path normalization. Math, currency and unknown shell variables stay prompt text;
  explicit named requests still fail closed for missing or ineligible skills.
- Catalog discovery reads at most 32,000 bytes from each skill file. Full
  bodies are read only for selected inline skills; the main process never
  reads a selected isolated skill's full body.
- The on-demand chunk tier (advanced-context-paging PRD PR-1, D1/D2) is
  declared by a nested `chunks:` frontmatter block (one entry per chunk:
  `name`, required `description`, optional `summary`, optional
  `key_elements`). The block is split out before flat frontmatter parsing
  so nested `description:` lines never corrupt skill-level fields. Chunk
  files live under `<root>/skills/<slug>/chunks/<name>.md` and are read
  through `read_chunk` (global-layer fallback included). Enforcement is
  fail-closed at every layer: `MAX_CHUNKS_PER_SKILL = 32`,
  `MAX_CHUNK_BYTES = 24_000`, plus per-field caps (description 240,
  summary 480, ≤ 8 key elements), duplicate-name rejection, and
  manifest-vs-disk validation (every declared chunk must exist and be in
  size). Any violation makes the skill routing-ineligible with an explicit
  `invalid chunk manifest: …` reason — never a silent truncation. Skills
  without a `chunks:` block take the byte-identical pre-chunk code path:
  no extra filesystem reads, identical catalog summaries, identical
  routing reports (`tests/chunk_store.rs` G5 proofs). PR-4's D3 eval
  returned **ADOPT** (2026-09-12,
  `docs/foundation/context-paging-pr4-eval.md`), so
  `CHUNK_METADATA_ROUTING_ENABLED = true` ships — automatic chunk routing
  feeds on `description` + `summary` + `key_elements`, with the eval
  harness (`tests/chunk_routing_eval.rs`) asserting flag/verdict
  consistency. PR-2 adds two-level routing:
  a bounded second pass ranks each selected inline skill's manifest
  entries (feed per the shipped condition; `orchestrate_with_condition`
  is the eval seam), loads at most
  `MAX_CHUNKS_PER_SELECTION = 3` bodies into `SkillRoutingReport.chunks`
  (`LoadedChunk { skill, name, body }`), counting them against the
  per-skill 24K pool and the shared 60K total; over-budget or unreadable
  chunks are skipped with `skill::chunk` rejection reasons, never
  truncated; isolated skills load no chunks; zero-overlap chunks never
  auto-load. `tests/skill_routing.rs` owns the AC-2 proofs. PR-3 moves the
  chunk payloads onto `LoadedSkill` (the report-level `chunks` view stays
  as a flattened accessor) and emits them in `context()` inside the skill's
  envelope block as named
  `<agent-vesper-skill-chunk skill name>` sections after the primary
  slice. Hosts append the envelope transiently and restore the original
  user message before persistence (AC-3); direct, VRO, and ReAct paths all
  consume the same host-composed history. AC-3 integration proofs live in
  `crates/vesper-harness/tests/context_paging_composition.rs` — the
  composition boundary that legitimately depends on both `vesper-memory`
  and `vesper-agent` (the architecture gate rejects a direct
  `vesper-agent → vesper-memory` edge).
  - Ranker hardening (its PRD): the chunk tier tokenizes routing text
    with `raw_semantic_tokens` — stemmed, stop-worded, NOT alias-expanded.
    The prompt-side pool keeps expansion (skill-tier scope). The
    cross-talk pin (`tests/chunk_routing_eval.rs::cross_talk_pin_…`)
    guards this permanently: two-sided chunk-tier alias expansion
    fails it.
  - Chunk-tier score floor (chunk-score-floor PRD, PR-2): admission is a
    **conjunction gate** `(overlap >= 1 || name_match) && score >=
    MIN_CHUNK_ROUTING_SCORE (520)` in `rank_chunks` — cosine only ranks
    already-eligible candidates and can never admit one (hashed-cosine
    noise between disjoint pools measured up to +0.6547 → 1,440 pts).
    The noise-floor pin (`noise_floor_pin_zero_overlap_prompt_routes_nothing`)
    asserts zero-overlap prompts route zero chunks; the
    genuine-overlap control stays green. Skill-tier arithmetic
    (`AUTO_ACTIVATION_SCORE`) untouched.
  - Chunk-name admission is **delimiter-bounded** (PRD Q1, resolved
    2026-09-13): `chunk_name_matches` requires the validated name
    alphabet `[a-z0-9-_]` to not continue past either edge of the
    occurrence, so `comet` does not admit from `pcometq` or
    `auto-comet-review`, while `comet`, `"comet"`, `read comet,` still
    route. Skill-tier `phrase_matches` (plain `contains`, 4 call sites:
    slug/name scoring, triggers, exclusions, risk terms) is deliberately
    unchanged — the boundary rule is chunk-tier-local.

## Work Guidance

- When adding a new memory kind, update `MemoryKind`, the resolver map
  in `apps/agent-vesper-tui/src/commands.rs`, and the dispatch handler.
- Keep `MemoryError` messages secret-safe: never include file contents,
  API keys, or full paths in error text. Use `vesper_security::path`
  helpers for path confinement.
- The append-only JSONL log is the source of truth for memory entries;
  `forget` rewrites the file by filtering lines (single atomic rename).
- The awareness ledger is the **in-process** epistemic state; persistence
  is opt-in via `save()`/`load()` to a single JSON file. The harness
  (not this crate) is responsible for keeping the live state coherent
  with provider evidence.
- Bundle files are durable grouping metadata only; bundles are activated
  explicitly, fail as a unit when a requested member is missing, ineligible,
  unreadable, or conflicting, rank members within the normal three-skill cap,
  and never implicitly execute, mutate, or widen permission.

## Verification

- `cargo test -p vesper-memory` — unit + integration tests (stores, routing
  against the curated catalog, eligibility, bundles, isolation, adversarial
  body non-selection, bounds, and feedback).
- `cargo xtask architecture` — confirms the new crate satisfies the
  production dependency allowlist and the source-tree unsafe ban.
