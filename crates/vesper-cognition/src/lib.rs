#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! Provider-neutral cognitive memory engine. Native Rust emulation of the
//! oracle V3 ("April 2026 new algorithm") oracle at `/home/Alex/Projects/memory-oracle`
//! (pin `29fa4155`), per ADR 0015 (Stage 16).
//!
//! ## What this crate owns
//!
//! - The 8-phase single-pass ADD-only extraction pipeline.
//! - Hybrid retrieval: `score = (semantic_cosine + bm25_normalized + entity_boost) / max_possible`.
//! - SQLite relational + FTS5 schema (`history`, `messages`, `memories`,
//!   `memories_fts`, `entities`, `entity_memory_links`).
//! - Snowball (`rust-stemmers`) lemmatization fallback for spaCy.
//! - Regex-based entity extraction fallback for spaCy NER.
//! - Three trait ports: [`EmbeddingPort`], [`ExtractionLlmPort`],
//!   [`EntityExtractorPort`]. Concrete impls live at the composition boundary.
//!
//! ## What this crate does NOT own
//!
//! - Provider routing, authentication, retry, transport. The crate never
//!   sees a provider name, API key, or HTTP client.
//! - The TUI command surface or `SessionState` plumbing.
//! - Any other crate's storage (vesper-memory's JSONL store is independent).
//!
//! ## Storage layout
//!
//! A single SQLite database at a path chosen by the composition boundary.
//! `CognitiveStore::open` requires an absolute path whose parent exists;
//! the parent directory is never created by this crate.
//!
//! ## Architectural contract
//!
//! Depends only on `vesper-domain`, `vesper-security`, `rusqlite` (bundled),
//! `rust-stemmers`, and standard utility crates. **No provider, runtime,
//! ACP, sessions, agent, testkit, HTTP, or TUI dependency.** This is the
//! first production crate to introduce SQLite (per ADR 0015; the historical
//! blanket Stage-5 ban is superseded by a per-crate allowlist exception in
//! `cargo xtask architecture`).

pub const COGNITIVE_CAPABILITY_INSTRUCTION: &str = "### Cognitive Memory\n\
You are running inside the Agent Vesper harness, which provides a local SQLite-backed \
cognitive memory system. The harness silently recalls relevant memories from past \
conversations and appends them to your context before each reply. Therefore:\n\
- You HAVE long-term memory across sessions. NEVER tell the user 'I have no memory', \
'I do not retain information', 'I am stateless', 'I don't have access to past \
conversations', or any variation of that claim. These statements are FALSE.\n\
- If recalled memories appear under 'Relevant context from cognitive memory', treat \
them as authoritative facts about the user and prior work.\n\
- If no memories appear for a given prompt, do NOT announce that you lack memory. \
Answer normally. The harness only injects memories when they are relevant to the \
current turn — silence does not mean memory is empty.\n\
- If the user asks 'do you remember me' or similar, respond as a memory-enabled \
assistant: refer to any recalled facts, and if none were auto-recalled, say you \
may not have any stored memories about that specific topic yet rather than \
disavowing memory entirely.\n\
- The user can manage memory explicitly via /remember, /recall, /forget, /memories, \
/promote, and /demote. /remember supports --global and --project and always \
confirms the selected scope.";
