# Configuration contracts

## Purpose

Own platform-aware Agent Vesper paths, profile validation, typed application
configuration, provider envelopes, secret references, and persistence ports.

## Local Contracts

- Stage 1 resolves and describes paths but never creates, migrates, or writes user state.
- Legacy Native GLM ACP locations are always read-only descriptors.
- Config, data, cache, state, and logs remain distinct.
- Provider values are opaque envelopes; raw secrets are prohibited.
- `sandbox_config.rs` owns the `[sandbox]` scope demand reader and
  `web_config.rs` the `[web]` opt-in scope reader (VRO-14 PR-5:
  `enabled`/`respect_robots`/`output_budget_bytes`/`allowlist`, plus the
  default-off interaction/render gates, fetch gate, user agent, immutable
  `[web.driver] image`, and fail-closed network/private-address settings);
  web keys accept their documented dotted/nested forms. Both readers are
  deliberately dependency-free TOML-subset readers (no `toml` crate —
  see their module docs), missing files yield the inactive default, and
  unknown keys are ignored for forward compatibility.
- An explicitly saved `.agent-vesper/web-settings.json` is the complete web
  settings snapshot and takes precedence over `[web]` TOML. Missing snapshots
  fall back to TOML; malformed snapshots fail closed. This crate only reads
  them; explicit atomic persistence belongs to `vesper-harness::web_settings`.

## Verification

- Run `cargo test -p vesper-config`.
- Run `cargo xtask architecture`.
