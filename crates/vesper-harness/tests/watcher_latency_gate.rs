#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! VRO-13 PR-7 latency gate (harness-side, integration).
//!
//! The watcher sweep must never degrade the interactive keystroke path.
//! This test proves the structural properties the design relies on:
//!
//! 1. **No lock coupling.** The sweep's fire path takes no lock that the
//!    keystroke path also takes. `run_sweep_once` + `probe_watcher` touch
//!    only the watcher store and the state root; the TUI's render path
//!    (`SessionState`, input buffer) is untouched. The test drives 10,000
//!    synthetic keystrokes through the pure input-buffer state machine
//!    while a sweep runs **on a background thread**, asserting the
//!    keystroke path never blocks on sweep progress.
//!
//! 2. **FD-count parity.** The sweep holds no persistent descriptor beyond
//!    its state-root files: before/after FD counts in this process match,
//!    so the 10s-cadence loop cannot leak one descriptor per tick.
//!
//! The keystroke-path *dispatch* gate (10,000 keys through the TUI's real
//! resolver) lives in the TUI crate's own integration test
//! (`apps/agent-vesper-tui/tests/watcher_dispatch_gate.rs`) because the
//! resolver is TUI-internal and cannot be imported from here.
