//! VB-PRD-001 Phase 2: the shared `/bridge` host-command answers.
//!
//! Host-level, read-only text. Session control (`stop`/`resume`/`release
//! confirmed`/`disconnect`) is EXECUTED by the host against the live
//! service — those verbs never appear here as static text, and this
//! module never panics (audit H4/L3: shared command code must answer
//! truthfully, not `unreachable!()`). Connect and execute flow through
//! the model tool surface so every operation passes the same Bridge gate.
