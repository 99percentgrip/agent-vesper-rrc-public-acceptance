# ACP protocol adapter

## Purpose

Own official ACP Rust SDK integration, protocol-v1 compatibility, request and
update mapping, and bounded asynchronous dispatch into `vesper-runtime`.

## Local Contracts

- `/acceptance` is argument-dependent for concurrency: status/settings inspection is
  safe, while start/resume/revise/stop/export interrupt or serialize against active
  work. Native completion reports remain host-owned results rather than model-supplied
  status.

- ACP SDK and wire types remain inside this crate.
- SDK callbacks enqueue bounded work and never await provider completion.
- The compatibility layer owns legacy `PromptResponse.userMessageId` placement.
- Stdout transport carries ACP JSON-RPC only.
- Session updates must reach the physical writer through bounded flow control;
  SDK-internal queues may not defeat runtime backpressure.
- Load/resume replay is visible history, plan, metadata/mode, available
  commands, then lifecycle response; every update is writer-accepted first.
- A successful prompt turn is persisted through the injected runtime writer
  before the prompt response is sent; the save runs inside the prompt's
  detached task so the dispatcher loop never blocks. A persistence failure
  surfaces a sanitized request error with a stable reason and the dispatcher
  continues serving other requests.
- The crate is provider-neutral, maps persistent read outcomes through runtime,
  and performs no direct persistence I/O.
- Corrupt, unsupported, bounded, denied, unsafe, workspace-mismatch, and
  write-failed records return sanitized request errors without terminating
  dispatch.
- Client-declared `mcpServers` on `session/new` are accepted and ignored
  (oracle parity): Zed attaches every configured MCP server to each session,
  so rejecting them made the agent unloadable with `-32602`. The harness MCP
  registry remains the sole MCP source; no client server is launched.
- Slash-command parity (ADR 0010 Tier C): `available_commands_update`
  advertises the frozen 28-command `vesper-domain` catalog **plus the shared
  host-neutral extension catalog** (`HOST_PARITY_SLASH_COMMANDS`, currently
  18 commands — 46 total; the count is asserted in
  `adapter::command_catalog_tests::frozen_catalog_stays_exact_and_extensions_append`)
  exactly once for
  `session/new`, `session/load`, and `session/resume`; `fork` advertises
  nothing (fixtures/acp/fork-session parity). On `session/new` the
  notification is sent only AFTER the response — clients such as Zed
  register the session when the response is processed and drop
  `session/update` notifications for unregistered sessions ("unknown
  session"), so a pre-response advertisement never reached the Zed
  slash-command menu. Load/resume sessions are already registered
  client-side, so those advertisements stay before the response (replay
  ordering). With an injected prompt engine, `/`-prefixed prompts route to
  the engine, which owns catalog execution; without an engine they fail
  closed with `-32601` instead of dispatching the provider. Slash turns
  report `AcpPromptResult.persist_turn == false` and are not appended as
  user/assistant turns (the `acp.slash-command` fixture expects unchanged
  file hashes). A validated `/compact` result is the narrow exception:
  `history_replacement` atomically replaces provider-working history and is
  saved without persisting the slash text itself.
- `AcpEngineEvent`/`AcpEventSink` are the streaming-engine vocabulary
  (`ReasoningDelta`, `ContentDelta`, `ToolStarted`, `ToolFinished`, `Usage`,
  `PlanUpdated`); the adapter sink maps each to the same wire shape the
  single-turn event pump produces. Full-harness updates are serialized in
  emission order and drained through physical-writer acceptance before the
  terminal response. Live `PlanUpdated` markdown is converted to structured
  ACP `plan` entries (including status and priority) so editor clients render
  their native TODO surface; an empty plan publishes an empty entry list.
  A streamed content turn must not append the complete
  final text again; engines with no content deltas retain the one-chunk final
  fallback. Engines that lack tool-call ids pair
  started/finished calls by the most recently issued id per tool name (the
  agent loop executes tools strictly sequentially). Successful mutating
  `ToolFinished` events retain bounded change metadata; the v1 adapter exposes
  path/operation/totals in `raw_output` instead of fabricating the complete
  old/new documents required by ACP's native `Diff` payload.
- Session config options: `thought_level` and `permission_mode` remain
  oracle option ids; `thought_level` routes through an injected provider
  control surface when present and uses the runtime fallback only without
  one. `permission_mode` remains runtime-modeled (the permission
  control advertises the oracle value `read`, which the setter accepts).
  Provider-owned footer controls (`model`, `api_endpoint`,
  `generation_profile`, `auxiliary_model`, `mixture_mode`) flow through
  `controls.rs`'s provider-neutral `SessionControlSurface` injected via
  `AcpAdapterConfig::controls`: the composition boundary contributes the
  descriptors (contribution order is the render order — model first),
  per-control live current-value resolvers read from the session envelope,
  and a provider-owned apply closure maps a validated `(id, value)` onto a
  merged envelope plus an optional new model. The adapter validates every
  selection against the contributed options (fail-closed
  `unsupported-session-config-value` for invented values), dispatches the
  runtime `UpdateProviderConfiguration` command, and re-advertises the
  options from the fresh snapshot on `session/new`/`load`/`resume`/`set`.
  A host-supplied refresh closure rebuilds descriptors from each session's
  current model/provider before validation and advertisement; no static boot
  model list may authorize a later provider's values. Refresh is read-only and
  does not mutate another session's controls.
  Without an injected surface only the two built-in options exist.
- `AcpAdapterConfig::additional_commands` appends only composition-implemented
  host-neutral commands to the frozen 28-entry compatibility catalog. The
  default remains exactly 28 for oracle fixtures; production ACP appends the
  shared host-parity catalog and advertises it on new/load/resume.
- Session mode/config requests are mapped to runtime mode, reasoning, and
  permission updates; delete and logout have explicit protocol responses.
- `AcpPromptEngine` is an optional composition port. When injected, prompt
  engine shutdown is awaited on transport EOF and dispatcher/event-pump exit
  before runtime shutdown; detached native work must settle or return an
  explicit cleanup failure. The default shutdown hook is inert for engines
  without owned background resources.
  With an injected engine, prompt
  requests route through a host's bounded multi-turn `vesper-agent` loop and
  are published with ACP backpressure. Cancellation notifications are routed
  to the injected engine as well. Editors may precede a concurrent-safe slash
  prompt with `session/cancel`; the bounded grace path suppresses that cancel,
  and per-session in-flight counts ensure completion of the slash response
  cannot erase the still-running implementation turn. Every advertised command
  is exhaustively classified as always concurrent, argument-dependent, or
  interrupting, so read-only subcommands remain usable during live work while
  state-colliding forms interrupt. The adapter supplies a bounded
  `session/request_permission` bridge to injected engines; cancellation
  resolves any pending approval and the engine must fail closed on rejection
  or a missing bridge. Without an injected engine, the runtime single-turn
  path remains available for protocol conformance. Engine failures must be
  pre-sanitized, bounded, actionable classifications; the adapter preserves
  that safe reason in ACP error data instead of flattening every failure to a
  generic `harness engine failed` message.
- `AcpPromptResult.history_replacement` carries a validated full working-set
  replacement from semantic compaction. The adapter commits it through the
  runtime actor before saving/responding; absent replacement retains ordinary
  `persist_turn` behavior.
- `vro_events.rs` (VRO-10, PRD §16) owns the VRO status-event vocabulary
  surfacing orchestrator phase transitions to upstream ACP clients. The
  `VroEvent` enum mirrors the 13 PRD §16 event names (`reasoning.profiled`,
  `reasoning.strategy_selected`, …, `reasoning.completed`); each variant
  carries `session_seq: u64` (PRD §16: "monotonic sequence numbers"),
  optional `branch_id` (PRD §16: "Parallel branch events must carry branch
  identifiers"), and a user-safe markdown `summary` (PRD §8.2).
  `translate_vro_event_to_acp(session_id, &VroEvent)` translates each event
  into an ACP `AgentMessageChunk` notification (PRD §16: "Where ACP has no
  dedicated event, VRO events should be translated into existing session
  update or status mechanisms without changing required top-level wire
  fields"). `VroEventSink` is the trait port the orchestrator pushes events
  through; `RecordingVroEventSink` is the test fixture. Errors are
  diagnostic-only — a translation failure must never abort a turn (PRD §17).

## Verification
