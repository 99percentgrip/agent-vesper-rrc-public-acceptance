# vesper-sandbox

## Purpose

Own the opt-in OS sandbox backends with honest, probed capability reporting
(VRO-13 PR-3, ADR 0022). The library is **100% safe code**; every raw syscall
(`unshare`, `mount`, uid/gid map writes, `fork`, `prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG)`,
`execve`) lives in the dedicated `sandbox_init` supervisor binary spawned
through safe `std::process`.

## Ownership

- `vesper-security` owns `SandboxCapabilities`, `IsolationRequirement`, and
  the fail-closed `satisfies` semantics this crate consumes.
- This crate owns the namespaces backend, the supervisor protocol, the
  credential-free env allowlist, and bounded output handling. It never
  decides policy; it only reports what it can honestly do and refuses
  everything else.

## Local Contracts

- Strictly opt-in: nothing here is constructed unless a tool explicitly
  demands `IsolationRequirement`. With no demand the executor path is
  byte-identical to the pre-sandbox path.
- Capabilities are **probed, never assumed**. `sandbox_init probe` exits 0
  only if user+mount+PID+network namespaces all provision; any failure
  reports `Unavailable` and every isolation demand fails closed
  (`SandboxError::CapabilityUnavailable`).
- Caller UID/GID are captured before unshare. The supervisor's private tmpfs
  root exposes only a non-recursive writable workspace bind, read-only system
  trees, selected device files, private tmp and child-PID-namespace procfs.
  The child chroots, translates the granted cwd, clears effective/permitted/
  inheritable/bounding capabilities and sets no-new-privileges before exec.
  Absolute payload paths and correctly encoded allowlisted environment values
  are required. Empty staging directories remain inside retained worker artifacts.
  ADR 0027 refines confinement without changing the supervisor protocol.
- Handshakes are bounded to 1024 bytes and five seconds. Stdout/stderr drain
  concurrently with retained byte caps while the command deadline is enforced;
  pipe closure and post-kill reaping are separately bounded and fail truthfully.
- One run per provision: `hold` reads a single unit-separator-delimited
  line from stdin, the child runs as PID 1 of the PID namespace, and killing
  the supervisor chains PDEATHSIG → PID-1 death → kernel SIGKILL of every
  namespace member. Explicit teardown observes kill/reap failures; Drop is only
  best-effort cleanup, not proof that the process tree is gone. Poisoned process
  ownership fails explicit teardown; Drop recovers the lock for best-effort reaping.
  Runtime waits use polling deadlines with at most 500 ms post-kill reap grace,
  never an unbounded final `Child::wait`. OS-stalled process cleanup remains an
  explicit failure, not an isolation guarantee.
- Environment hygiene: `SandboxSpec` carries an exact allowlist; the
  supervisor clears every inherited variable. The default baseline
  (`baseline_env`) is credential-free — no provider keys, tokens, or
  cognition-root paths ever enter a sandbox.
- Output is capped at `OUTPUT_CAP_BYTES` (64 KiB per stream). Timeouts kill
  the supervisor and report `timed_out: true` rather than hanging.
- `src/pipe.rs` owns optional container duplex channels: NUL-framed input
  capped at 512 KiB, output frames at 16 MiB, one queued frame, absolute
  send/receive deadlines, no payload logging. Pipe drop kills/reaps the exec
  client and releases its sandbox handle before joining I/O threads. Backends
  without duplex support explicitly refuse; the namespace protocol is unchanged.
- `sandbox_init` is the **only** production component allowed `unsafe`. It
  carries `#![allow(unsafe_code)]` + `#![deny(unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn)]` +
  `#![deny(clippy::undocumented_unsafe_blocks)]`, and every unsafe block
  carries an adjacent `SAFETY:` comment. This is the ADR 0022 exception
  under `crates/AGENTS.md`; no other module may follow it.
- Linux-only: `libc` is a dependency only under
  `[target.'cfg(target_os = "linux")']`. Off Linux the honest stub
  (`UnavailableBackend`) reports everything unavailable and fails closed.
  The `sandbox_init` binary likewise compiles to an inert entry point off
  Linux, so workspace-wide test builds never link Linux syscall symbols there.
- A supplied Podman connection is local to the backend. All probes, run/exec,
  duplex and recorded teardown commands retain it; no global default changes.
- Docker backend (VRO-13 PR-4) is **feature-gated** behind
  `--features docker`; default builds gain zero new dependencies. It wraps
  `docker run --rm -d` with `--cpus`/`--memory`/`--pids-limit` limits, a
  bind-mount of the canonicalized primary root at `/workspace`, and
  `--network none` unless the scope demand explicitly grants network.
  The cold-start guard probes `docker version` first: an unreachable
  daemon yields the model-facing "sandbox unavailable … the operation
  needs isolation" refusal before any `docker run` is attempted, and
  `capabilities()` reports everything `Unavailable` — never assumed.
  Pinned images are probed locally before provisioning, with no implicit pull.
  Per-request network grants and resource overrides are honored. Concurrent
  bounded stream draining avoids deadlocking on output larger than an OS pipe.
  Container startup waits at most 30 seconds (or the shorter request budget);
  cleanup CLI waits at most five seconds plus the 500 ms post-kill reap grace.
  Explicit Docker cleanup accepts only a successful command exit and verified
  local supervisor reap. Missing/empty commands, nonzero exits, spawn/wait errors
  and poisoned ownership fail closed; nonzero is never assumed to mean absent.
  `src/teardown_tests.rs` uses real local child/CLI fixtures for status, ownership
  and reap checks; it does not substitute for namespace/container acceptance.
  Ephemeral containers set `--stop-timeout 0`, so force-removal does not wait
  a runtime's default service-stop grace beyond the cleanup CLI budget.
  `SandboxSpec::private_root_label` is explicit/default-false: only dedicated
  worker roots may opt into private SELinux `:Z` labeling through `--volume`.
  Ordinary workspace mounts preserve labels and keep the existing `--mount`
  route. Ambiguous private volume separators refuse before spawning; neither
  privileged mode nor disabled SELinux/network isolation is a repair strategy.
  Daemon-side cleanup cannot be promised while the daemon is unavailable;
  every detached container retains a finite lease as the fallback bound.

## Work Guidance

- When adding a new backend, implement `SandboxBackend` and report honest
  probed capabilities; never claim strength the platform did not verify.
- When changing the supervisor protocol, update this doc, the binary's
  module docs, and ADR 0022 in the same change.
- Unavailable namespace policy remains a truthful refusal. Do not attribute a
  failed UID map to host policy without checking the captured outer IDs; the
  prior post-unshare overflow-ID bug is repaired and local real gates pass.

## Verification

- `cargo test -p vesper-sandbox`
- `cargo test -p vesper-sandbox --test namespaces namespace_security_and_timeout_acceptance -- --ignored --nocapture`
  requires the real supervisor and checks confinement, zero capabilities,
  output saturation, timeout and reap. It fails rather than skipping.
- `cargo clippy -p vesper-sandbox --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`
- `cargo xtask architecture` (enforces the ADR 0022 allowlist)
