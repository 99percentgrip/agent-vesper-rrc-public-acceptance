# Z.ai GLM provider adapter

## Purpose

Own production GLM provider identity, catalog, endpoint/authentication policy,
wire serialization, HTTP/SSE transport, retry/cancellation, continuation,
quota normalization, and legacy GLM compatibility translation.

## Ownership

- `src/` owns production adapter behavior behind `vesper-provider` ports.
- `src/integration_tests.rs` owns deterministic loopback integration and fixture
  conformance. Its `lens_wire_tests.rs` child verifies interview schema/name,
  call linkage and complete structured notes/answers serialization, as the GLM
  counterpart to native OpenAI tests; it does not certify browser/host delivery.

## Local Contracts

- Stream interruption diagnostics preserve the shared explicit `Cancelled` cause
  when the native agent loop retains a cancelled partial response.

- Depend only on `vesper-auth`, `vesper-domain`, `vesper-provider`,
  `vesper-config`, and `vesper-security` in production.
- `vesper-testkit` is permitted only as a dev dependency.
- Use no live provider calls or real credentials in tests.
- Bound every wire line, event, tool field, metadata value, and error prefix.
- Credentials are attached only at dispatch and never enter normal formatting,
  serialization, errors, events, or fixtures.
- Do not expose HTTP or GLM wire types through neutral provider ports.
- `ProviderSession::query_usage` maps the bounded native monitor response to
  shared account windows, retaining provider percentages and reset timestamps.
  Presentation is shared by TUI and ACP, not duplicated in the hosts.
- Emit no event after terminal completion or cancellation.
- Never replay after visible output. Reasoning/content-only interruptions use
  the adapter's bounded continuation request with accumulated assistant state;
  partial tool calls stop safely, while a fully assembled call at clean remote
  EOF is emitted once with its stable ID.
- Streaming uses independent connect, read-inactivity, and absolute-generation
  bounds. The default absolute generation ceiling is 30 minutes; active Deep/
  Max streams are not terminated by the former three-minute whole-request
  timeout.

## Work Guidance

- Keep exact GLM wire compatibility inside this crate.
- Keep environment-variable precedence and legacy credential reads, but route
  all new stored credentials through `vesper-auth`.
- Use loopback ephemeral servers and synthetic credential sources in tests.
- ADR 0009: advertise **one** session-scoped reasoning dial (`zai:reasoning`,
  alias `thinking`, scale `{disabled, enabled, high, max}`). The former
  separate `zai:effort` and `zai:interleaved-thinking` controls are retired;
  `low`/`medium` are invalid. `reasoning_mode_for_superpower` maps a resolved
  `SuperpowerValue` into the runtime reasoning-mode label; `serialize_request`
  already turns `request.reasoning.mode` into the wire `reasoning_effort` /
  `thinking` pair.
- Model registry lives in `catalog.rs` (`GlmModelInfo` table) and is the shared
  catalog source for ACP and TUI. `glm-5.3` is the current flagship and adapter
  default. `glm-5.3-flash` is a 1M-context, 128K-output native multimodal model
  on the documented Coding/Standard Z.ai plans; it accepts URL/Base64 image
  blocks and exposes only its documented `enabled`/`max` reasoning modes.
  Loopback conformance fixtures are captured against
  `glm-5.2` and pin it explicitly in `configured_session`/`fixture_request` —
  they prove wire parity, not the default model.
- Z.ai currently documents no capability-bearing model-discovery endpoint.
  Keep catalog updates adapter-owned and evidence-backed; never infer plan,
  vision, limits, or reasoning from a remotely returned model id.
- PRD `provider-capability-gating` FR-2: `factory.rs` advertises the full
  session-control surface as superpower descriptors — `zai:plan` (alias
  `plan`: coding/standard/bigmodel), `zai:generation` (alias `generation`:
  balanced/precise/exploratory), and `zai:auxiliary` (alias `auxiliary`:
  `main` + every catalog model). The harness consumes these for its
  `/plan` / `/generation` / `/auxiliary` rows and value palettes.
  `policy.rs` (`GlmSuperpowerPolicy`) owns the choice rules: `auxiliary`
  keeps `main` plus plan-available non-vision models, `mixture` narrows
  tool-capable candidates to non-vision plan-available advisers, and
  `validate` rejects ineligible auxiliary selections. GLM predicates never
  leak into the TUI.
- `GlmSession` exposes its bounded non-streaming `AuxiliaryRequestPort` through
  `ProviderSession::auxiliary`. `zai:auxiliary-model` is decoded into
  `GlmConfig`, validated against the active endpoint plan, and replaces the
  wire `model` only for tool-free auxiliary requests; `main` retains the
  acting model.
- `policy.rs` `GlmCapabilityAdvisor` resolves capability alternatives only
  from `GlmCatalog` and the active endpoint plan. Bounded provider error
  prefixes may classify unsupported image/content responses into the shared
  typed requirement before visible output.

## Verification

- Run `cargo test -p vesper-provider-glm --all-features`.
- Keep the complete nine-tool request serialization regression green; names,
  descriptions, schemas, ordering and the documented default-auto intent must
  reach the GLM request unchanged.
- Run `cargo xtask provider glm verify`.
- Run strict workspace Clippy and architecture checks.
