# Provider-neutral domain

## Purpose

Own stable IDs, messages, content, usage, outcomes, errors, session metadata,
plans, goals, permissions, capabilities, versioned runtime commands/events,
read/write-free frozen compatibility DTOs, and the Vesper Reasoning
Orchestrator (VRO) Phase VRO-1 domain contracts.

## Local Contracts

- `src/acceptance.rs` owns ADR 0028 strict versioned requirement, platform, evidence,
  finding, receipt and report values. DTO deserialization is not verification authority.
  `/acceptance` is in the shared host-parity command catalog.

- `slash_commands::SkillRoutingControl` is the shared pure parser for
  `/skills settings status|save mode standard|enhanced|save model-assistance on|off|save enable|disable <skill>`.
  It does not change the frozen oracle command descriptors or authorize tools.

- This crate depends on no workspace crate and performs no I/O.
- No ACP SDK, provider SDK, frontend, transport, or concrete-provider type may
  enter these DTOs.
- Serialized unknown/provider data stays namespaced and opaque.
- Legacy GLM names may appear only in the explicit compatibility module.
- Event sequences are scoped to runtime/session/turn ownership and turn
  terminals are unique.
- `FinishOutcome::StreamInterrupted` carries a provider-neutral classified
  cause (including explicit cancellation) plus the tool-call ambiguity bit; transports must not collapse
  deadline, inactivity, remote EOF, and transport failures into one label.
- Hidden internal chain-of-thought is not a domain content requirement.
- `ModelRequirement`, `ModelCandidate`, and `CapabilitySuggestion` are the
  bounded provider-neutral capability-recovery DTOs. Candidate construction
  caps at three and rejects cross-provider alternatives.
- `src/slash_commands.rs` owns the frozen-oracle ACP slash-command catalog:
  28 commands with byte-stable names and descriptions (verbatim from the
  pinned oracle's `_send_available_commands`, verified against
  `fixtures/acp/slash-command`) plus the pure case-insensitive
  `parse_slash_command` parser. It is plain data — no stores, no I/O;
  store-backed execution lives in `vesper-harness`. It also owns the separate
  shared host-parity extension descriptors, including ADR 0024 `/skill` and
  workspace `/web` settings, plus the separately feature-gated
  `SWARM_SLASH_COMMAND` descriptor, so
  ACP advertisement and TUI registration are checked against one foundation
  catalog. The ACP oracle catalog is a
  distinct oracle surface from the TUI's `LOCAL_COMMANDS` palette (79+3
  commands); the TUI keeps its own registry rather than collapsing onto this
  28-command subset.
- `ToolDefinition.defer_loading` is the visibility axis for the Claude
  Code-style deferred-loading seam: when `true`, the tool stays registered for
  execution but is excluded from the registry's advertisement. `provider_scope`
  is the separate provider-eligibility axis (`Any` or one `ProviderId`) and is
  enforced at advertisement, deferred injection, and execution. Both fields
  carry serde defaults so existing serialized definitions remain universal and
  non-deferred unless an owning composition opts into tighter behavior.
- `FileChangePreview` and its operation/line-kind DTOs are bounded,
  provider-neutral descriptions of a successful filesystem mutation. They
  carry display/absolute paths, complete addition/deletion totals, a bounded
  line preview, optional one-based `start_line` (absent for legacy/unknown),
  and an explicit truncation bit; they never perform I/O or
  imply that a transport rendered a native diff.
- `src/vro.rs` owns the VRO domain contracts per
  `docs/agent-vesper-reasoning-orchestrator-prd.md`: `ReasoningMode` (§8.1),
  `ReasoningStrategy` (§10.3 — the authoritative 10-variant enum),
  `TaskProfile` (§14.2; `ambiguity` is `f32`, so the struct derives `PartialEq`
  but not `Eq`), `ReasoningBudget` (§10.4 — `u16` for
  `max_parallel_branches`/`max_search_depth`/`max_repairs`), and the
  `ReasoningConfig` `[reasoning]` block (§24). VRO-2.1 added the remaining §14
  data contracts — `ReasoningRequest` (§14.1), `DeliberationArtifact` (§14.3),
  `Candidate` (§14.4), `ReasoningOutcome` (§14.5) — plus `VerificationResult`
  (§10.8), `OutcomeStatus`, `VerificationStatus`, `PrivacyMode`, and the
  `InferenceCost`/`VerificationSummary`/`WorkflowPlanStep` placeholders. VRO-2.2
  upgraded `VerificationFinding` from a `String` placeholder to a real struct
  (`message`/`severity`/`location`) with a `VerificationSeverity` enum, and
  added `VerificationStatus::Error` (the verifier itself could not run, distinct
  from `Failed`). VRO-3.1 added `ModelCapabilities` (PRD §10.2). VRO-10
  (PRD §10.5 + §14.3 + §10.4) closes three final PARTIAL/DEFERRED gaps:
  (1) `WorkflowPlanStep` now carries the five previously-missing §10.5
  fields (`expected_output_schema`, `failure_policy: StepFailurePolicy`,
  `max_attempts`, `parallel_allowed`, `requires_user_approval`) with
  conservative serde defaults so legacy plans deserialize unchanged;
  (2) the VRO-2.1 free-form `String` aliases `Assumption`, `EvidenceRef`,
  `ContextRef` are promoted to **strict newtypes** (`Assumption` carries
  `statement`/`confidence: Option<f32>`/`status: AssumptionStatus`;
  `EvidenceRef` carries `kind: EvidenceKind` + `locator`; `ContextRef` carries
  `kind: ContextKind` + `locator`) — `From<&str>`/`From<String>`/`AsRef<str>`
  impls keep every existing call site compiling, so the type-level strictness
  is gained without a use-site rewrite. `DeliberationArtifact` now derives
  `PartialEq` only (not `Eq`) because `Assumption` carries `Option<f32>`;
  (3) `OutcomeStatus` gains the `RateLimitExceeded` variant (PRD §10.4
  "account for provider rate limits") so the orchestrator halts cleanly on an
  HTTP 429 instead of crashing. Provider names are FORBIDDEN in this file
  (xtask architecture guard scans for them). Budget preset values pinned by
  §24 are sourced from the PRD; fields §24 does not pin carry documented
  Phase R3 calibrated baselines. No orchestration logic lives here.

## Verification

- Run `cargo test -p vesper-domain`.
- Run `cargo xtask architecture`.
