//! The hive orchestrator (VRO-15 PR-9).
//!
//! [`HiveOrchestrator`] composes everything the previous PRs built into
//! one coherent engine: topology ([PR-2]), pooled workers ([PR-3]), the
//! priority bus ([PR-4]), assignment scoring ([PR-5]), the ledger
//! ([PR-6]/[PR-7]) — over explicit ports or independent factory-backed pools. It is
//! provider-neutral orchestration logic: no network/filesystem I/O or provider names. The
//! real execution adapter (provider session + tools) lives at the
//! composition boundary; tests drive the same seams with fakes.
//!
//! Concurrency contract: the orchestrator exposes one [`Hive::run_tick`]
//! driven by the caller's task (mirroring the pool's caller-owned
//! interval pattern). It never spawns hidden tasks, never touches a
//! render thread. Interrupted goals are retained and never automatically replayed.
//!
