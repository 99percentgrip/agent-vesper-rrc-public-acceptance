//! Task-level governance for the hive (VRO-16 PR-1).
//!
//! Bounded human-in-the-loop gates with default-action timeouts, strictly
//! per-task suspension, and an observable-signals-only pause evaluator.
//!
//! Purity contract: this module performs no I/O and reads no clock. All time
//! enters as caller-supplied Unix-epoch milliseconds (`now_ms`), mirroring
//! the ledger's timestamp-source seam. Gate countdowns are **derived** from
//! the `GateOpened` wall-clock record — never from a ticking timer — so a
//! governor rebuilt from its audit trail computes identical remaining time
//! (the restart proof).
//!
//! Ratified decisions (docs/advanced-hive-governance-prd.md §1):
//! - D1: every gate has a bounded countdown and a pre-configured fallback;
//!   expiry fires the fallback automatically. No unbounded waits exist.
//! - D2: suspension is per task. A gate on one task never blocks sibling
//!   tasks; dependents stop at the ordinary dependency wall.
