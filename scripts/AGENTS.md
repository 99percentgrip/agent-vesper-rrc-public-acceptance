# Installation scripts

## Purpose

Own the cross-platform installers and uninstallers that download one verified
release archive, install or remove both `agent-vesper-acp` and
`agent-vesper-tui` on the user's PATH, and produce the same first-run UX as the
original Python `native-glm-acp` installer. Also owns the ACP Registry PR
submission payload used to sync the published `agent-vesper` registry entry
with each release. The read-only release prerequisite helper also lives here.

## Ownership

- `release_gate.py` verifies the latest exact-SHA main-push run and its complete
  attempt-specific successful job set for all four release workflows; pagination,
  changed attempts and missing/skipped/running evidence fail closed.
  `test_release_gate.py` supplies offline structured GitHub fixtures.
  It also checks matching push/PR documentation exclusions in all four workflows,
  retained gates for executable inputs and refusal to tag filtered commits.

- `install.sh` — POSIX installer (Linux + macOS). Downloads the
  `agent-vesper-acp-<platform>-<arch>.tar.gz` release, verifies SHA-256,
  installs both launchers under `$XDG_BIN_HOME` (default `~/.local/bin`),
  updates the shell profile PATH, and bundles the standalone `uv` binary
  (from `astral-sh/uv` latest release) into the bundle dir so the
  push-to-talk voice backend can auto-bootstrap a `faster-whisper` venv via
  the bundled `uv` with no external venv toolchain. (The bootstrap's
  `python3 -m venv` fallback still needs system `python3`+`python3-venv`, but
  is only reached if the bundled `uv` is absent.) A failed `uv` download is
  non-fatal.
- `install.ps1` — Windows installer. Downloads the
  `agent-vesper-acp-windows-x86_64.zip` release, verifies SHA-256, installs a
  `.cmd` launchers under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\AgentVesper`, and adds that
  directory to the user PATH.
- `uninstall.sh` — POSIX uninstaller. Removes only the launcher, bundle, and
  exact shell-profile PATH marker owned by `install.sh`.
- `uninstall.ps1` — Windows uninstaller. Removes only the launcher, bundle,
  and exact user PATH entry owned by `install.ps1`.
- `publish_to_acp_registry.sh` — VRO-11.2 publishing helper for the public
  ACP Registry (`agentclientprotocol/registry`). Clones the registry to a
  temporary directory, writes `registry/agent.json` from this repo into the
  `agent-vesper/` directory, reuses the branch tracked by the open PR, and
  updates that Pull Request in place. CONTINUOUS-UPDATE CONTRACT
  (maintainer-mandated 2026-08-18):
  there is exactly ONE long-lived open `agent-vesper` PR. Never close it to
  open a new one; never comment that it is superseded. For every version
  bump: PUT the updated `agent.json` to the SAME branch the open PR tracks
  (force-push if rebased), then edit the PR title/body in place via
  `gh api repos/agentclientprotocol/registry/pulls/<N> -X PATCH`. The local installers
  (`install.sh` / `install.ps1`) consume `registry/agent.json` from this
  repo, NOT this script. Replaces the deleted `acp_pr_439.md` payload
  (VRO-11.2: that file was stale — it claimed to be the payload for PR
  #439, but PR #439 is the `native-glm-acp` Python project's PR and is
  intentionally left untouched; `agent-vesper` is a separate agent entry).

## Local Contracts

- The installers download from `github.com/99percentgrip/agent-vesper`
  releases for the matching tag (`v<version>`, or `latest`).
- SHA-256 verification is mandatory; a missing/mismatched checksum fails the
  install.
- Installed launchers invoke their bundled binary verbatim and add no behavior.
- Until the public ACP Registry PR is merged, installer completion guidance
  directs Zed users to register the installed launcher with `type: custom`;
  it must not imply that the agent is already discoverable from the registry.
- Credentials are not stored by the installer. First-run guidance leads with
  the TUI's Agent Vesper Authentication screen and also documents `agent-vesper-acp --setup` and
  the optional `ZAI_API_KEY` environment override.
- Uninstallers never remove provider credentials. OS-keyring entries and the
  private-vault fallback are outside the installer-owned artifact set.
- The installers call both binaries with `--version` to confirm success.
- Complete packages include the native `sandbox_init` supervisor beside the host
  binaries (inert off Linux), replaced as an installer-owned payload.
- Complete packages include `web-driver/` (archive, checksum, immutable ID).
  Both installers call the bundled ACP binary's `--setup-web-driver` to
  verify/import it. Missing or stopped Docker/Podman leaves the archive
  installed and gives the in-app Set up features / repair route. Native guided
  setup may install an engine after separate confirmation; installers themselves
  do not authorize OS package or VM installation. The flow must not require
  users to search for driver assets. Setup never enables workspace web tools.
  Older packages without the archive receive an explicit upgrade notice.
- POSIX upgrades remove legacy launcher symlinks before writing replacement
  launchers; launcher creation must never follow a symlink into the freshly
  installed bundle and overwrite its binaries.
- Upgrades replace only the named binaries, seed library, and driver payloads,
  never the bundle root. Co-located cognition databases, voice environments,
  and other user state retain their paths and inodes in both installers.
- The installers seed the curated skill library (from the bundled
  `skills/` archive directory) into `~/.agent-vesper/memory/`
  non-destructively: existing files win, slugs listed in
  `.seed-manifest` are never resurrected, and new seed skills from later
  releases are added on upgrade. `AGENT_VESPER_MEMORY_ROOT` overrides the
  destination. Uninstallers never touch `~/.agent-vesper/` (user data).
  The library includes `work-unit-reporting` (95 skills), which implements
  the completion-reporting behavior both hosts also inject via the shared
  `COMPLETION_REPORTING_INSTRUCTION` system-prompt mandate.

## Verification

- `python3 scripts/test_release_gate.py` verifies the publishing workflow gate.

- `sh scripts/test_install_upgrade.sh` verifies payload replacement while
  preserving cognition contents/inode, voice state, and unrelated user files.
- Shellcheck-clean `install.sh` (POSIX `sh`, no bashisms).
- Shellcheck-clean `uninstall.sh` (POSIX `sh`, no bashisms).
- `install.ps1` runs under Windows PowerShell 5.1+ and PowerShell 7.
- `uninstall.ps1` runs under Windows PowerShell 5.1+ and PowerShell 7.
- After install, both `--version` commands print the workspace version and both
  binaries are reachable on `PATH`.
- Installer completion output identifies custom Zed registration as the
  pre-registry path.
