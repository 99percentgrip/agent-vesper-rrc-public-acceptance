# Agent Vesper ACP executable

## Purpose

Compose configuration, the GLM factory, minimal runtime, ACP adapter, stdio
transport, stderr-only tracing, and orderly shutdown.

## Ownership

- VB-PRD-001 composition is behind the default-off `bridge` build
  feature. `bridge_enabled_from_settings()` resolves the explicit
  user-owned `.agent-vesper/bridge-settings.json` once per process
  (fail-closed) and `with_bridge` attaches the harness Bridge service;
  the disabled build compiles zero bridge code. `/bridge` (status,
  discover, stop, disconnect) answers read-only at host level; connect
  and all application actions flow only through the model tool surface
  and the pure core's gate.
- VRO-15 composition is behind the default-off `swarm` build feature.
  `src/swarm_host.rs` wires the shared native service and workspace Save/Cancel
  controls, active provider configuration, configured semantic embeddings,
  memory recall, scoped tools, permission/progress and cancellation. `/swarm`
  is advertised from the shared feature descriptor only in that build.
  Persisted opt-in never bypasses capability, embedding or tool permission checks.
  Final swarm reports are explicitly emitted after worker progress and include
  artifact paths. Transport shutdown cancels active work and observes service
  cleanup; pending human approval observes the same cancellation signal.
  Full acceptance remains tracked in the F01–F18 matrix; do not advertise broad
  activation before those gates pass.

## Local Contracts

- Provider-owned controls are intersected with the selected non-secret
  authentication method before runtime configuration. Stale API-key-only xAI
  values cannot enter a Grok-session request.
- The integration-only xAI loopback route exists solely for real ACP process
  composition tests and is absent from normal builds.

- MCP stdio ownership is per ACP session ID, retained across turn registry
  rebuilds and removed on clear-history or engine shutdown (ADR 0031).
  Identical configurations in distinct sessions never share browser state.
  Every turn filters hosted definitions against its resolved active provider;
  the Z.ai credential bridge is injected through the harness closure seam so
  this app does not add a forbidden direct `vesper-mcp` dependency.
  `mcp_owners_are_per_acp_session_and_reused_between_turns` verifies ownership.

- ADR 0028/0029 `/acceptance` and `/settings acceptance on [PRD]|off` compose the shared
  native completion gate. Saved activation is loaded before dispatch; live authority
  remains per-session and outside compaction. Empty-path opt-in admits pending
  automatic enrollment; direct and Swarm dispatch capture the original user request
  for independent candidate-scope review before remembering a PRD path. VRO/Swarm drafts return through the parent
  gate; direct cancellation retains the incomplete report/history. Default controls
  create no evidence state; `tests/acceptance_controls.rs` checks the real isolated ACP
  process.

- `/release patch|minor|major|status|resume|cancel|evidence|retry` delegates to
  the shared harness Release Recovery Controller and answers without ordinary
  provider dispatch. If the controller admits a bounded repair, ACP supplies its
  current operating/permission modes and client-backed permission port to
  native release stages and the isolated repair AgentLoop; missing
  client permission support fails closed. `/ci` includes the same persisted
  controller status as TUI; ACP never keeps a host-private release lifecycle.
  `../agent-vesper-tui/tests/release_hosts_pty.py` exercises both native hosts
  against one synthetic ledger with no provider dispatch.

- `/skills settings status|save mode standard|enhanced|save enable|disable <skill>`
  uses the shared domain parser and harness preferences. Reads create no workspace
  state; explicit saves affect later turns. Routing uses the same memory selector
  and workspace preferences as TUI, with native permission/mode restrictions.
  `tests/skill_routing_controls.rs` also drives ordinary `use the … skills` prose
  through the real ACP process, asserts one preserved provider submission, and
  proves a later turn; explicit-invocation parsing remains owned by `vesper-memory`.
  TUI owns the interactive grouped draft; ACP exposes explicit text saves.
  `save model-assistance on|off` controls the same default-off provider selector;
  enabling selects Enhanced. The engine resolves it before direct/VRO dispatch,
  registers cancellation during selection and emits bounded routing notices.
  The selector has no tools and does not persist selection prompts.

- User cancellation returns ACP's protocol-native `Cancelled` stop reason
  only when the session's host-owned cancellation token and a
  cancellation-classified runtime terminal agree. Partial streamed output,
  completed tool updates and returned working history remain intact for later
  turns. A coincident timeout, provider failure or uncorroborated provider-side
  cancellation remains a failure.
- Contain no session, provider-wire, or ACP-mapping business logic.
- Stdout is exclusively newline-delimited ACP JSON-RPC.
- Tests use loopback endpoints and synthetic credentials only. The shared process
  harness supplies explicit signed-out OpenAI and xAI vault records under its
  temporary root; environment/HOME isolation alone does not isolate an OS credential
  manager. Native provider fixtures override transport with synthetic loopback
  constructors. Process tests compare external config inventories before and after.
- No provider child process or raw credential I/O is created by the ACP
  composition itself. The shared `vesper-harness` service may perform bounded
  workspace-scoped tool I/O and MCP/plugin subprocess work only after a model
  tool call passes the agent permission gate. The explicit `--setup`
  authentication commands (`--setup`, OpenAI `--login`/`--logout`) delegate
  credential writes to the owning adapter. Native subscription dispatch may
  persist a refreshed token under the adapter's operation lock.
- Session readers are disabled unless explicitly enabled, use bounded
  filesystem stores, reject unsafe roots, and never create missing roots.
- Workspace-scope identity resolution is read-only by default: the
  editor-spawned ACP process must not create `.vesper-scope-id` in a project
  unless `AGENT_VESPER_ENABLE_SCOPE_STAMP=1`. This persistence policy does
  not change the resolved scope id, so TUI↔ACP scope identity remains equal.
- Session writers are disabled unless explicitly enabled via
  `AGENT_VESPER_ENABLE_SESSION_WRITES`; the application constructs and injects
  `VesperSessionWriter` but delegates every mutation, atomic rename, and
  sidecar generation to `vesper-sessions`. The write root defaults to the Agent
  Vesper read root (`AGENT_VESPER_SESSION_WRITE_ROOT` or
  `AGENT_VESPER_SESSION_ROOT`) and must be absolute with an existing parent;
  `AGENT_VESPER_SESSION_WRITE_MAX_BYTES` bounds the record size.
- Durable editor-chat registration must enable both session writes and Agent
  Vesper session reads; writes commit completed turns, while reads provide
  list/load/resume after the editor launches a fresh ACP process. Checkpoint
  enablement is independent and is not required for conversation persistence.
- Provider selection is a composition-boundary concern resolved before the
  runtime is constructed. Production registers Z.ai GLM, LM Studio, and
  native OpenAI in every boot so the ACP `provider` footer picker (TUI
  `/provider` parity) can switch between them mid-session. The initial
  acting provider comes from the `--provider` flag or
  `AGENT_VESPER_PROVIDER` (accepted tokens: `glm`/`zai`, `lmstudio`, `openai`). The
  deterministic synthetic adapter is reachable only through the
  `integration-test-harness` feature and must never be advertised as a real
  provider or model. The runtime stays provider-neutral; provider-specific
  configuration, credential overrides, and endpoint identity apply only to
  the selected adapter.
- The default endpoint assigned to freshly created sessions is injected by the
  composition boundary so persisted records carry a stable endpoint identity:
  `zai-coding` for the GLM adapter, `lmstudio-local` for the LM Studio
  adapter, and `synthetic` for the synthetic adapter.
  The runtime stays provider-neutral.
- OpenAI model controls use authenticated discovery at startup, intersected with
  the adapter capability catalog. Missing/hidden/unverified choices cannot be selected;
  a failed lookup leaves an empty picker and explicit restart guidance. Refresh requires
  restarting ACP after authentication/connectivity changes (TUI refreshes on Settings
  entry). Keep the same discovered factory instance in registry and controls so
  dispatch/worker gates reject unavailable models. Vision and per-model context limits
  remain adapter-owned, including text-only Spark's 128K window. Both authentication
  modes use the same agent loop, tools, workers, compaction, and permissions;
  native device sign-in needs no Codex installation. The terminal Settings
  modal is host-specific: ACP users sign in through TUI or explicit
  `--provider openai --login`; ACP stdout never displays a device code.
- LM Studio transport sends the active request model, so native model changes do
  not silently keep using the launch model. Its loopback wire test verifies the
  request body through the real AgentLoop and adapter.
- Memory extraction follows the launch provider. An OpenAI launch uses the
  native Responses auxiliary path without Z.ai/LM Studio credentials. The
  independent embedding configuration and local fallback stay unchanged.
  Restart the host to change the memory extractor after a footer provider swap.
- The non-default `integration-test-harness` feature may compose generic
  synchronization wrappers, but the default release binary must not contain a
  dispatch gate or scenario behavior.
- The default ACP composition injects `AcpHarnessEngine`, which owns bounded
  per-session conversation history and routes prompts through `AgentLoop`.
  Agent-loop failures are projected into bounded safe classifications (for
  example context limit, rate/quota category, interrupted stream, or loop
  detection) before crossing the ACP boundary; never collapse all failures
  into an unactionable generic harness error and never expose raw provider
  payloads.
  Interrupted outcomes are transactional prompt responses: partial assistant
  text and plan remain in history/persistence, while the bounded diagnostic
  states the cause and whether recovery was withheld because a tool call had
  started.
  Native plans continue across up to four ordinary iteration segments without
  a user-authored rescue prompt. The per-session plan map seeds every later
  loop invocation, including user-authored resume turns, so acknowledgement
  text cannot terminate a still-open plan before another `update_plan` call;
  an ultimate-cap outcome must state that work remains and retain the latest plan.
  The engine also owns the TUI-parity feature surface (see the parity
  contract below): the cognitive-memory bundle, VRO orchestration, the
  tool-enforcement and cognitive-capability system instructions, and the
  silent pre-reply memory recall injection.
  The composition also injects the multi-provider footer control surface
  (`src/controls.rs`). GLM model presentation, plan eligibility, context
  limits, vision, and reasoning choices derive from
  `vesper-provider-glm::GlmCatalog` (no app-local model table). The adapter
  advertises `provider` (TUI `/provider`
  parity — lists every registered adapter with live credential status in
  each description; switching stamps `vesper:active-provider` into the
  session envelope and swaps the acting `QualifiedModelId` so the next turn
  dispatches to the selected adapter; GLM keeps its `zai:` overrides across
  round trips; unauthenticated GLM descriptions tell the user to run
  `--setup`) plus the controls of the **acting provider only** (PRD
  `docs/provider-capability-gating-prd.md`): when `zai` acts, the full
  oracle-parity GLM set — `model` (MoA picker first, then the plan's
  models), `thought_level` (deep levels only on deep-reasoning models),
  `api_endpoint`, `generation_profile`, `auxiliary_model`, `mixture_mode`;
  when `lmstudio` acts, ONLY a truthful `model` picker fed by the adapter's
  cached native `/api/v1/models` catalog (verified LM Studio schema: live
  model ids, advertised context sizes; the pinned settings model always
  present as the offline fallback; no GLM plans/thinking/generation/
  auxiliary/mixture controls — the OpenAI-compatible wire carries none of
  them). GLM-only selections made while another provider acts are rejected
  fail-closed (never a silent cross-provider route). `permission_mode` is
  always advertised. Selections are validated against that surface,
  dispatched to the runtime `UpdateProviderConfiguration` command, and
  applied to the engine's turn configuration (footer picks take effect on
  the next turn; engine slash-command overrides layer on top). The
  adapter's `context_window` follows the acting provider — GLM's frozen
  per-model sizes for `zai`, the LM Studio model's advertised
  `max_context_length` for `lmstudio` (conservative 8K floor when
  unadvertised; never GLM's 1M for a local model) — so the Zed token
  counter (`usage_update`) sizes against the selected model.
  The engine uses that same per-provider/model map for manual and automatic
  compaction after live footer switches, shares pressure-tier notification
  state across successive requests, and streams compaction and quality
  warnings through ordinary ACP updates.
  `tests/provider_selection.rs` is `integration-test-harness`-gated: the
  synthetic boot token it uses exists only under that feature. The fixture
  uses explicit signed-out OpenAI/xAI records and an isolated cwd, and reaps its
  owned child on failure; its five-second protocol and EOF assertions remain.
  The engine executes the 28-command oracle slash catalog in-process
  (ADR 0010 Tier C) with full TUI harness parity: catalog commands answer
  from the harness executor with no provider dispatch, `/max-iterations` and
  model/plan switches persist as per-session engine overrides, unknown `/`
  text answers with the oracle's bounded unknown-command fallback, and the
  shared host-neutral extensions (`/remember`…`/journey` plus VRO-13
  `/firewall`, which reports the process-global firewall state from
  `vesper-policy::firewall::holder` and never mutates it at runtime) are
  answered host-side in `try_slash_command` before the engine parser runs.
  `/firewall` is a host-parity command, not one of the frozen 28, so the
  `try_slash_command` arm intercepts and answers it explicitly — it never
  falls through to the domain parser (which would answer with the
  unknown-command fallback) even though ACP advertises it.
  Every host-owned command is really wired — `/checkpoint`, `/rollback`, `/undo`,
  `/export`, `/sessions`, `/lineage`, `/ci`, `/plugins`, and `/mcp` run on
  the shared `vesper-harness` host-command executor; the checkpoint-family
  commands are opt-in per the gating contract above (when enabled, they run
  against the same durable checkpoint/MCP roots the TUI uses, and
  `/checkpoint` and `/lineage` seed a session lineage record named for the
  ACP session id); `/compact`,
  `/clear-history`, and `/clear-plan` mutate the engine's own per-session
  history and plan maps (`/clear-plan` republishes an empty plan update);
  `/usage` queries the registered session's neutral read-only account port and
  renders the same clean aligned status panel as TUI, with explicit unknown limits
  when unavailable; `/diff` replaces the prompt with the TUI's workflow text
  and drives one real agent turn; `/release` executes through the shared
  persisted `vesper-harness` release controller and returns its status without
  provider dispatch. Slash turns report `persist_turn == false` and never enter
  conversation history as slash text. `/compact [focus]` is the additional
  stateful exception: it installs and persists the validated semantic history
  replacement; `/diff` workflow turns persist like ordinary prompts. The ADR 0024 `/skill <name|bundle:name> [task]` extension replaces
  the slash text with a real workflow prompt and uses the same `vesper-memory`
  router as the TUI across direct and VRO paths. Automatic routing also runs
  on every ordinary prompt. Bodies are transient, selected identities are
  observable, missing/ineligible explicit requests fail before provider
  dispatch, and outcome feedback is bounded and content-free. The engine's
  progress port pairs tool started/finished events by the most recently issued
  id per tool name, forwards bounded filesystem-change
  metadata and shared bounded shell excerpts to the ACP adapter, and records the latest per-session plan
  markdown. Rich terminal red/green diff painting is a TUI-only presentation
  detail; ACP clients receive truthful path/operation/addition/deletion
  metadata and may choose their native presentation. Syntax colors, blinking dots
  and report/table layout are terminal-only; ACP clients own rendering. Actual
  shell exit/timeout failures and bounded excerpts are shared with TUI. The adapter injects a live ACP `session/request_permission`
  port for mutating tools; rejection, cancellation, unavailable clients,
  and malformed outcomes remain fail-closed. The engine injects the shared
  hosted Python-oracle tool surface and bounded project instruction
  context, and opens `MemoryStores` with the cross-project global skill
  layer (`AGENT_VESPER_GLOBAL_MEMORY_ROOT` → `~/.agent-vesper/memory`), so
  `/skills` lists global learned skills exactly like the TUI. Set
  `AGENT_VESPER_FULL_HARNESS=0` only for protocol-conformance fixtures that
  must exercise the provider-neutral single-turn runtime path; production
  defaults to the full engine.
- Mixed and image-only prompt blocks remain intact through harness
  composition. Capability failures name the active model and up to three
  catalog-verified alternatives; switching stays an explicit user action via
  the existing model selector. Multimodal turns use `AgentLoop` because the
  VRO candidate interface is text-only.

## TUI↔ACP Parity Contract

Settings → Providers is a terminal-specific presentation of the existing
provider selection capability. ACP keeps its native `provider` configuration
control and next-turn switching; it does not render TUI Save/Cancel modals or
inherit the TUI's restart-only preference workflow. The TUI Manage
authentication panel is also terminal-only. ACP keeps `--login`, `--setup`,
and `--logout`, and both hosts read the same provider credential port.

The opt-in web surface uses the shared harness web service and its contained
fetch/render/browser runtime. No ACP-specific driver or network fallback
exists; deployment and image prerequisites are in `docs/web-tools.md`.

`/web status|detect|setup|<enabled|fetch|render|interact|robots> <on|off>` uses the
shared web-settings service against the request's primary workspace. Saves
are explicit user actions, never startup writes or provider tool calls.
Settings require a host restart and do not change an in-flight turn, so this
command is concurrent-safe. The TUI-only settings modal has the same controls.
`/web prepare` previews dependency setup; `/web prepare confirm` executes the
shared service, emits fixed progress through ACP content events and observes
session cancellation between OS transactions. OS authorization uses native prompts,
never protocol stdin/stdout. `--setup-features --confirm` exposes the same explicit
pre-provider operation. Runtime preferences are user-wide, separate from web saves.
`--setup-web-driver` is an explicit installer preflight before provider or ACP
boot. It verifies/imports the bundled image, writes diagnostics only to stderr,
and does not create workspace state or enable web tools.

Every host-agnostic capability shipped in the TUI MUST also be wired here
(root `AGENTS.md` Project Contracts). Current ledger:

- **Cognitive memory** (`src/cognition.rs`, ACP composition of the shared engine):
  `CognitionBundle::open_default` opens the SAME durable stores as the TUI
  (project `.agent-vesper/cognition/` + global
  `~/.local/share/agent-vesper/cognition/`), honors the same
  `embedding.json` (ADR 0016) source selection (local / lmstudio /
  bigmodel / provider-routed), routes extraction Zai → LM Studio → NoOp,
  and re-embeds on embedder-model change. Surface: silent pre-reply recall
  injection (restored out of history before persist, TUI parity), the
  `/remember` `/recall` `/forget` `/memories` `/promote` `/demote`
  `/embedding` slash family (including live `/embedding set` and
  `/embedding clear`), the shared `cognitive_capability_instruction`, and
  the VRO-7 procedural-memory learning sink. Changes to this module MUST
  be evaluated in the TUI composition (and vice versa). The model-facing
  instruction and host-parity extension catalog are shared foundation
  constants with registration/advertisement tests.
- **VRO reasoning orchestration**: opt-in via `AGENT_VESPER_VRO_ENABLED=1`
  (TUI parity). `should_orchestrate` routes non-Direct, non-ReAct profiles
  through `VroOrchestrator::execute_with_learning` with an
  `AcpCandidateGenerator` bridging the shared `AgentLoop`; `/reasoning set
  mode=<auto|fast|balanced|deep|maximum|off>` overrides the profiler
  per-session; strategy and ✓ LEARNED notices surface as
  `ReasoningDelta` events (the client's reasoning channel).
- **Native browser feedback**: `tool_registry` composes the shared
  `vesper-harness::lens_tools` executor in direct, VRO and swarm paths. Review
  URLs use ACP content events; explicit review/interview results return through
  the same AgentLoop tool transaction as TUI. ACP does not launch desktop apps.
- **Justified exclusions** (host-specific UX): TUI rendering niceties
  (single-column layout, markdown renderer, scrollbar, bracketed paste,
  F-keys), push-to-talk voice (interactive terminal capture and playback),
  desktop browser launch, `/interview-limit` (the ACP interview currently uses
  the bounded automatic 1–12 question policy), and terminal-only
  catalog commands. ACP advertises the frozen 28-command compatibility
  catalog plus the shared implemented host-neutral extension catalog.
- **VRO-17 voice exclusion:** ACP v1 advertises
  `promptCapabilities.audio = false` and exposes no microphone capture,
  speaker playback, live voice status, Voice Settings, speech-provider picker,
  or F5/F9/Stop surface. It must not place raw PCM, local playback state or
  terminal voice status on ACP stdout. Voice-origin text in the TUI still uses
  the same provider-neutral registry/runtime dispatch and cancellation path as
  ACP text turns; future `VoiceStt`/`VoiceTts` adapters therefore require no ACP
  protocol extension or reasoning-provider branch. The real-process
  `process_transcript` test pins the audio capability and absence of voice
  configuration/command advertisement. Starting ACP without an explicit user
  action must not initialize microphone, speaker, STT, TTS or model workloads.

## Sandbox `/sandbox on|off|status` (VRO-13 PR-4)

`/sandbox` answers the boot-resolved scope-demand route (process-global,
once-only holder, exactly like `/firewall`), with argument handling
byte-identical to the TUI's (host-parity contract):

- bare or `status` — the live route body (active backend + demand + route
  instance, or the truthful no-route notice pointing at
  `.agent-vesper/config.toml` `[sandbox]`).
- `on` / `enable` — the honest restart instruction: the demand lives in
  `[sandbox]`; edit it and restart. Never a fake runtime toggle.
- `off` / `disable` — restart with `AGENT_VESPER_SANDBOX=off`.
- anything else — the shared usage error listing `on|off|status`.

The route itself is resolved at host boot (`AGENT_VESPER_SANDBOX=docker|off`
plus the `[sandbox]` scope demand); the Docker backend requires a
`--features docker` build of this composition, and a build without it
refuses a docker demand honestly instead of falling back.

## Checkpoints and Lineage Are Opt-In

`/checkpoint`, `/rollback`, `/undo`, `/sessions`, and `/lineage` are
DISABLED by default in this composition (root contract): the shared
`HarnessToolService` is built with `new_with_checkpoint_gate(..., false)`
unless `AGENT_VESPER_ENABLE_CHECKPOINTS` is truthy or
`AGENT_VESPER_CHECKPOINT_ROOT` is set explicitly. Gated commands answer
with the opt-in notice and the service creates no durable
checkpoint/lineage directories at boot. `/ci` stays available (read-only);
`/export` writes an explicit user-requested file only. The TUI host keeps
its always-on default because it is user-launched interactively.

## Mid-Turn Slash Grace (CANCEL_GRACE)

Editors interrupt a running turn by sending `session/cancel` immediately
followed by the new prompt — even when that "prompt" is an informational
slash command. The adapter holds engine-session cancels for 400ms
(`CANCEL_GRACE` in `crates/vesper-acp/src/adapter.rs`): a prompt from
`CONCURRENT_SAFE_SLASH_COMMANDS` (`/status`, `/usage`, `/max-iterations`,
`/memory`, `/skills`, `/reasoning`, the cognition family, … — read-only
reports and next-turn overrides whose stores are independent of the live
turn) arrives inside the window and ABORTS the cancel, so the turn keeps
working while the slash answers concurrently and its text lands in the
session context. Commands that collide with live conversation, plan,
workspace, or registry state (`/compact`, `/clear-history`, `/clear-plan`,
`/undo`, `/rollback`, `/diff`, `/release`, and mutating `/checkpoint`,
`/plugins`, or `/mcp` forms), any non-slash prompt, and grace expiry still
perform the cancel. Independent operations remain concurrent, including
`/export`, `/checkpoint list`, read-only `/plugins` and `/mcp` forms,
`/firewall`, and `/sandbox`.
`tokio::select!` is `biased` with notifications polled first so the
cancel+prompt pair is always evaluated together. The engine tracks
in-flight cancellations as a per-session SET (`Arc::ptr_eq` removal,
cancel-all on `session/cancel`) — concurrent turns on one session must
never overwrite each other's cancellation entry. The ACP adapter separately
tracks an in-flight COUNT per session, so completion of a concurrent safe
slash response cannot erase the still-running implementation turn.
`/max-iterations enable|disable|1-1000` is concurrent-safe, applies only to
later turns, and defaults to disabled while the hard safety ceiling remains.
Regression suite:
`apps/agent-vesper-acp/tests/midturn_slash_grace.rs` (real binary, slow
loopback provider). Adapter unit tests partition all 46 advertised commands
into exactly one always-safe, argument-dependent, or interrupting class.

## Verification

- `acp_host_registry_settles_large_command_output_and_recovers` exercises the
  real ACP hosted registry for mixed large output, truncation, timeout,
  cancellation, descendant-held pipes, and a successful following command.

- `tests/swarm_native_process.rs` explicitly checks Settings/run through real ACP
  transport with isolated state, configured loopback chat/embedding services,
  both scope modes, overlapping workers and final artifact-report delivery.

- Run process transcript tests with isolated environment roots.
- `tests/openai_native.rs` executes a real confined read and verifies its
  Responses call/result transaction in both native authentication modes,
  including provider round trips, effective model/effort changes, and a
  read-only write denial with proof that no file was created. It also checks account
  discovery headers, hidden/unknown model exclusion, rejection of unavailable model
  changes, and Spark's real tool transaction without `reasoning.summary`.
- `tests/openai_rejection.rs` verifies that native HTTP context rejections reach
  the ACP error response as `ContextLimit` in both authentication modes, without
  provider prose in protocol output or stderr. This does not prove that clients
  display error data or that arbitrary parameter diagnostics survive host mapping.
- Run the full-harness ordered-stream regression; it must preserve reasoning
  and content delta order, emit final content exactly once, and accept every
  update at the physical writer before `end_turn`.
- Run `process_blockers` with `--all-features`; the guarded test driver is
  unavailable otherwise.
- Verify stdout purity and stderr secret-canary absence.
- Run `cargo test -p agent-vesper-acp --lib --bins` for read-configuration
  tests without invoking process transcript suites.
- Run `cargo test -p agent-vesper-acp --tests --all-features` for the complete
  real-process suite; every persistence vector must prove exact hash, file-set,
  length, and modification-time invariance.
- The xAI `run_command` process proof writes to an explicitly named marker under
  the harness's isolated workspace root; it must not rely on an inherited or
  ambient shell working directory to locate its exactly-once side effect.
- Production composition registers and boots xAI through the same registry as
  the TUI. ACP exposes discovered xAI models and provider controls through
  session config selectors; explicit CLI device/API-key auth uses the provider
  credential port and never writes protocol data to stdout. `--provider xai
  --login` performs the same native browser/loopback flow and stores the same
  Grok-session credential class consumed by both hosts; device code remains the
  fallback.
  Capability checks use the adapter-owned xAI catalog at the composition
  boundary, including image eligibility. Controls intersect the authenticated
  billing mode: Grok-session omits API-key-only region, WebSocket, compaction,
  and hosted-tool selectors.
  Enumerated hosted-tool enablement uses footer selectors. Bounded structured
  values that ACP selectors cannot represent use the active provider's
  advertised session command aliases and remain adapter-validated.
- All-feature process tests stay offline even when the developer keyring holds
  a real xAI credential. The integration harness discovers xAI models only
  when xAI is the explicitly selected initial provider; normal production
  composition retains authenticated discovery for provider switching.
