# Agent Vesper TUI

## Purpose

Own the Stage 11b Terminal User Interface: provider-superpowers discovery,
the Plan Mode state machine, the slash-command registry, the
`TerminalRenderer` abstraction, and the `ratatui` + `crossterm` event loop.
The crate is a thin composition boundary that queries the runtime registry
for superpowers at startup and renders the active provider's controls
natively; it owns no provider-wire, ACP, persistence, or session-mutation
business logic.

## Ownership

- `src/landing.rs` owns the responsive theme-aware character-art welcome screen and
  pure navigation/layout; `src/landing_host.rs` owns its terminal event loop.
  Fresh interactive sessions show it after required authentication; explicit
  `--resume` skips it. Start coding enters the conversation; Settings opens the
  centered theme-aware settings menu. Keyboard and mouse use the same menu layout.
  Mascot rows use one fixed-width mirrored canvas; never center each row separately.
  Welcome, Settings and Web tools share the active `ui::theme_palette`, including
  background, text, accent, border and selected-row colors. A saved theme change
  applies when returning to the welcome screen, without restarting. Native theme
  choices persist user-wide in `~/.agent-vesper/ui/theme` (USERPROFILE on Windows,
  HOME elsewhere), independent of the workspace. If no global choice exists, a
  valid legacy `AGENT_VESPER_HOME/theme` (default `.agent-vesper/theme`) is imported
  once. Global choices take precedence over stale project files. Missing user-home
  information fails visibly rather than silently saving a workspace-only choice;
  malformed values fall back to the default.
  A failed save stays visible and never claims persistence.
  Web tools uses the same centered menu renderer and mouse geometry, with draft
  toggles and driver setup; the standalone editor retains Save and Cancel.
  `src/settings_menu.rs` owns shared geometry and palette for Settings, Providers,
  Swarm, acceptance and confirmations. `src/settings_host.rs` owns one cloned
  draft across ordinary submenus. Esc at the root offers Save changes, Discard
  changes and Keep editing. Only Save applies execution state; failed grouped
  saves restore prior bytes and retain the draft, reporting any rollback failure.
  Settings → Skills edits Standard/Enhanced (preview) and project skill toggles
  in that same draft and grouped rollback. A separate model-assistance toggle
  explains the configured-provider metadata call and added usage/latency. Enabling
  it selects Enhanced; switching to Standard makes assistance inactive. Direct, VRO
  and ReAct resolve prepared choices in the existing background turn, with routing
  notices on the same FIFO and original prompt content restored before persistence.
  Selection receives original task text, including on capability-switch retry;
  expanded file/diff references remain in the coding request only. Cancellation
  after selection returns before MoA, compaction or coding dispatch.
  Shared workspace preferences apply to
  the next turn; source skills remain unchanged. `/skills settings` also exposes
  the shared explicit-save text controls. Routing notices survive direct, VRO
  and ReAct startup; read-only controls narrow Enhanced selection.
  Ordinary preferences are user-wide `ui/settings.json`, provider-partitioned and
  revalidated on restore; web/swarm/acceptance remain workspace-scoped. Model
  choices retain adapter metadata and an actionable catalog retry. Provider
  authentication/switch saves and driver import are separate explicit side effects.
  Settings → Providers places Manage authentication directly under that provider.
  Down from the provider reaches its own action; moving to another provider does
  not retarget the previous action. M on the provider or its action opens the
  same descriptor-driven panel. It does not change the active provider or the
  Save draft. `/auth` and startup sign-in use
  that same panel. Authentication commits immediately and is not undone by Discard.
  Mouse hit-testing uses the renderer's geometry. Start coding alone enters chat
  from the welcome screen; `/settings` returns to its existing conversation.
  `src/update_host.rs` installs only after a separate release/version confirmation,
  using the installer embedded from `scripts/install.sh` or `install.ps1`. Checks
  use bounded public GitHub metadata without credentials. POSIX installation shows
  actual log progress; Windows opens an installer console that waits for the host
  to exit before replacing locked binaries. Success asks the user to reopen Vesper.
  Version arguments are validated; the current bundle is preserved as destination.
  Check/decline never installs. No live update is part of foundation verification.
  Cognition startup runs on a blocking thread before terminal entry because its
  client construction and local-store migration are synchronous.
  Provider/model labels come from the active registry surface and version from
  the package. This welcome/menu presentation is terminal-specific; ACP editors
  own their launch UI, so no shared capability or slash-command change is needed.

- Intentional turn cancellation is promoted to the benign `Cancelled`
  presentation only when the active host cancellation token and a
  cancellation-classified agent terminal agree. Normal conversation uses
  `Turn cancelled by user.` and disclaims rollback when completed actions
  exist; Last Run says `Cancelled`. Partial assistant output, completed tool
  telemetry, history and structured diagnostics remain available. Provider
  errors, timeouts and uncorroborated provider-side cancellation stay failures.

- Native Lens review/interview execution delegates to `vesper-harness::lens_tools`;
  TUI retains its live interview-limit policy, bordered UI and URL/browser-launch
  presentation. ACP uses the same feedback validation and native tool results.

- VB-PRD-001 composition is behind the default-off `bridge` build
  feature. `bridge_enabled_from_settings()` resolves the explicit
  user-owned `.agent-vesper/bridge-settings.json` once per process
  (fail-closed) and `with_bridge` attaches the harness Bridge service;
  the disabled build compiles zero bridge code. `/bridge` (status,
  discover, stop, disconnect) answers read-only at host level; connect
  and all application actions flow only through the model tool surface
  and the pure core's gate.
- VRO-15 composition is behind the default-off `swarm` build feature.
  `src/swarm_host.rs` wires the shared native service and workspace Save/Cancel
  controls, active provider configuration, configured semantic embeddings,
  memory recall, scoped tools, permission/progress and cancellation. `/swarm`
  is advertised from the shared feature descriptor only in that build.
  Persisted opt-in never bypasses capability, embedding or tool permission checks.
  Host exit cancels and observes native service cleanup, then awaits the report
  task and drains its final history event before persisting the conversation.
  Full acceptance remains tracked in the F01–F18 matrix; do not advertise broad
  activation before those gates pass.

- `src/provider_hub.rs` owns Settings → Providers (`/settings providers`,
  `/settings provider`, and compatibility shortcut `/provider`). It mirrors
  the Web tools panel layout with registry-derived choices, active/draft
  labels, explicit Save/Cancel, and restart guidance. Navigation alone never
  saves. Required LM Studio setup must be confirmed before the provider
  preference is written; cancelling either screen leaves that preference
  unchanged. This terminal-only presentation maps to ACP's existing native
  provider control, not an ACP terminal modal.
- `src/web_hub.rs` owns the standalone Web tools editor (`/web`, `/settings web`):
  draft on/off controls, explicit Save/Cancel, automatic installed-driver
  detection when opened, and confirmed Set up features / repair using shared
  `dependency_setup` progress. Esc requests stop between OS transactions; the
  current transaction and cleanup finish before returning. Runtime preparation
  is separate from the Settings draft. Import-only controls use `web_settings`.
  Changes are workspace-scoped and require host restart; the screen must say
  so. `/web` with arguments uses the same text controls as ACP. The interactive
  modal is terminal-specific; ACP exposes the shared slash controls instead.
  `--setup-web-driver` runs the same installer preflight before boot and never
  opens a terminal or provider session.

- `src/plan_mode.rs` — pure 4-phase Plan Mode state machine
  (NORMAL → PLANNING → REVIEW → EXECUTING) mirroring the Python oracle's
  `PLAN_MODE_PROMPT`.
- `src/auth_hub.rs` — pure provider-driven authentication startup state machine and
  responsive masked Ratatui renderer. It may expose only authentication
  descriptors registered by production provider adapters.
- `src/lmstudio_hub.rs` — pure LM Studio provider settings state machine +
  Ratatui renderer + atomic JSON persistence (`/lmstudio`). Mirrors the
  `auth_hub` pattern: the user adjusts the LAN/localhost `api_base_url` and
  optional pinned model **inside the TUI** (not a config file); the binary owns
  the terminal event loop and persists on `Save`. The settings file holds only
  non-secret fields (`$AGENT_VESPER_LMSTUDIO_ROOT` or `.agent-vesper/lmstudio/
  settings.json`); the optional API key is read from the `LMSTUDIO_API_KEY`
  env var (surfaced as a screen hint) — moving it to the OS credential store is
  the security follow-up.
- `src/commands.rs` — slash-command parsing, registry, and resolution
  against the active provider's superpowers. `/release` resolves to a typed
  shared RRC operation (start/status/resume/cancel/evidence/retry), never a
  free-form AgentLoop workflow. If the controller admits a bounded isolated
  repair, the TUI supplies current operating/permission modes and its ordinary
  approval port to both native release stages and repair; controller state never
  bypasses permission. `/ci` appends the same persisted RRC status shown by ACP.
  The terminal owns presentation only.
  Tier C Phase 7 (ADR 0010): the
  registry now covers the complete Python oracle surface plus Vesper-native
  commands (102 entries, or 103 with `swarm`, including `/export last`). The
  `ORACLE_COMMAND_SURFACE` const table is the single source of truth for the
  migration matrix. `chat-only` (the `/chat-only` palette twin of the F11
  keybinding) resolves to `UiAction::ToggleChatOnly`; like every registry
  entry it keeps `quit` last so the palette order contract holds. ADR 0016 follow-up: `/embedding` (Status/Set/Clear) is
  the most recent Vesper-native addition; it parses
  `key=value` pairs via `EmbeddingPairs::parse` and drains through
  `pending_embedding_op` → `drain_embedding_op` (write `embedding.json` +
  hot-reload + background probe of the new endpoint).
  VRO-8 (PRD §8.1): `/reasoning set mode=<auto|fast|balanced|deep|maximum|`
  off>` overrides the deterministic TaskProfiler; `/reasoning clear` and
  `set mode=auto` clear it; bare `/reasoning` reports the current override.
  The new arm is gated by `set mode=` / `clear` / empty-arg patterns so the
  oracle's existing `/reasoning <level>` superpower alias (resolves to the
  `thinking` descriptor) is fully preserved for any other argument shape.
  Resolves to `CommandOutcome::ReasoningOverride { mode }` /
  `CommandOutcome::ReasoningStatus`; `parse_reasoning_mode` is the
  six-variant parser (PRD §8.1 authoritative list + `max` shorthand for
  `Maximum`; rejects every invented mode with a usage error listing all
  six).
  ADR 0019: `/interview-limit` reports or changes the session-scoped
  VesperLens question policy. Bare reports; `auto` lets the agent choose
  1–12 decision-relevant questions; `1`–`12` sets a hard maximum. The default
  remains 4. The command, palette, tool schema, and executor share one typed
  policy, and the schema is rebuilt for every turn so the model sees the
  active value.
  VRO-13 PR-4: `/sandbox [on|off|status]` resolves to
  `CommandOutcome::ContextView(ViewKind::Sandbox)` (bare or `status`) or
  `CommandOutcome::SandboxControl(SandboxControl::On|Off)`. The route is
  boot-resolved (once-only holder), so `on`/`off` answer with the honest
  edit-config-and-restart instruction — byte-identical text to the ACP
  host's `/sandbox` surface (host-parity contract); unknown arguments get
  the shared usage error. `/status` surfaces `sandbox=on|off` alongside the
  firewall line.
  ADR 0021: cognitive memory is composed as two independent engines. The
  existing project store remains at `AGENT_VESPER_COGNITION_ROOT` or
  `.agent-vesper/cognition/`; the global store uses
  `AGENT_VESPER_GLOBAL_COGNITION_ROOT`, then
  `$XDG_DATA_HOME/agent-vesper/cognition/`, then
  `~/.local/share/agent-vesper/cognition/`. `/remember` smart-routes stable
  identity/preferences globally and repository facts locally, conservatively
  defaults ambiguous text to the project, accepts `--global` / `--project`
  (`--local`) overrides, and always echoes the chosen scope and reason.
  `/recall` and automatic recall search both stores, `/memories` audits them,
  and `/promote` / `/demote` move a short- or full-ID memory between them.
  ADR 0024 adds `/skill <name|bundle:name> [task]`: it builds a normal agent
  workflow prompt, then the shared provider-neutral router selects before
  direct, VRO, or ReAct dispatch. Automatic selections use the same route.
  Inline bodies are provider-request-only and restored from session history;
  isolated bodies stay in the bounded worker. Missing/ineligible explicit
  selections stop before provider dispatch, and terminal outcomes feed only
  bounded secret-free ranking feedback.
- `src/dispatch.rs` — pure, terminal-free event-loop dispatch: the bridge
  between the command registry, the Plan Mode state machine, and the
  `SuperpowerOverrides` store. Owns `SessionState`, `DispatchOutcome`, and
  `dispatch()`. The full Plan Mode lifecycle is unit-tested here under a
  `StubRenderer`; the binary owns only the crossterm input buffer.
  VRO-8 (PRD §8.1): `SessionState.reasoning_mode_override` holds the
  manual override; `SessionState::effective_reasoning_mode()` is the single
  function the binary consults before routing a VRO turn (returns the
  override, or `Auto` when none is set or when the override is itself
  `Auto` — both mean "profiler decides"). The dispatcher's
  `ReasoningOverride` arm normalizes `Auto` to `None` so the profiler is
  back in charge; `ReasoningStatus` reads the live override and surfaces it
  in the status line.
- `src/superpowers.rs` — `ProviderSuperpowerSurface` and
  `SuperpowerOverrides`, the pure projection the TUI keeps of the active
  provider's advertised descriptors.
- `src/capabilities.rs` — fail-closed per-model capability index
  (`ModelCapabilityIndex` + `CapabilityDenial`) over the active provider's
  catalog snapshot (PRD `docs/provider-capability-gating-prd.md`). Gates
  image input (`accepts_image`), tool/adviser eligibility
  (`adviser_candidates`), advertised reasoning levels, and exact context
  limits. `Unknown`, missing models, and empty advertised media-type lists
  deny with provider-neutral reasons mirroring
  `vesper_provider::resolve_support` (`Unknown` + `Require` → `Reject`).
- `src/ui.rs` — `TerminalRenderer` trait, `ViewModel`, `StubRenderer` for
  tests, and the production `render_to_frame` ratatui/crossterm backend.
  **Current layout:** the bottom Reasoning panel and Activity strip stay
  removed; the Conversation column owns chat, inline thinking, and tool
  telemetry. New sessions show a compact right rail on wide terminals with
  Session, a dedicated live TODO panel, and a bounded Last run summary.
  Session and Run keep fixed rows while TODO flexes at compact heights, so
  every rail surface remains visible at the 110×24 breakpoint. `/tasks`
  toggles the TODO region and reveals the sidebar when enabling it. F11
  (`toggle_chat_only`) collapses the entire right rail — Session + TODO +
  Last run — into a chat-only full-width view; the collapse is a pure
  render-time overlay (`PanelVisibility::chat_only`), so the per-panel
  `sidebar` / `tasks` flags keep their values and a second F11 restores the
  exact previous layout. The conversation is a borderless padded canvas, the
  composer uses one quiet top divider, and the optional utility rail uses one
  vertical divider with flat section headings rather than stacked rounded
  boxes. Theme selection owns a complete palette (canvas, header/rail/menu
  surfaces, text, muted text, accent, borders, selection, and warnings); UI
  chrome must never fall back to a hard-coded blue/slate surface. New sessions
  default to `chatgpt-black`; `/theme` also exposes `chatgpt-white`, ANSI,
  Light, Dracula, and Nord. The retired `vesper` preference is accepted only
  as a compatibility alias for ChatGPT Black. `/tasks` and `/statusline` clear the overlay when
  they explicitly reveal the rail. The footer advertises the F11 action
  beside the other mouse-operable footer segments. The provider
  chain of thought stays out of primary chat by default and becomes a bounded
  diagnostic tail only after explicit F2 opt-in. `transcript_lines_for` then
  emits a `thinking:`-prefixed block (compact
  `ReasoningDiagnostics::render_inline_header()` label + the newest
  `INLINE_THINKING_TAIL_LINES` reasoning lines) while a turn runs;
  `render_transcript_lines` renders `thinking:` entries dim + italic. `src/activity.rs` projects internal `⏺`/`⎿` records into chronological
  Read/Explored/Search/Edited/Ran rows with two-line result excerpts by default;
  Ctrl+T expands bounded result excerpts and diffs during or after the turn
  without replacing the final answer. Successful write/edit/apply operations
  add an inline `Edited N files (+A -D)` summary; Ctrl+T expands bounded
  per-file context with full-row green additions and red deletions. Signed
  `+A` / `-D` counts in compact and expanded diff headers stay green / red.
  Both the direct loop and VRO ReAct path feed the same typed change
  projection.
  Iterative provider commentary is also
  activity, not primary chat: on completion, all assistant text parts except
  the final part become bounded commentary telemetry whose count remains in
  the compact activity summary; raw iterative narration stays hidden even in
  Ctrl+T, and the final part remains the sole user-facing answer. The same
  compaction is a render-time projection for resumed transcripts created by
  older binaries:
  within each user turn, preceding assistant entries remain hidden in both
  views; tool activity retains execution order instead of regrouping by type.
  Resumed multiline/256+-character user prompts receive the same compact
  `[Pasted Content N chars]` presentation as newly submitted prompts. Review
  URLs remain visible in compact chat. `PanelVisibility`
  now means: `reasoning` = inline-thinking visibility (F2), `sidebar` =
  right-rail visibility, and `tasks` = dedicated TODO visibility. `ViewModel` no longer carries
  `reasoning_manual_scroll` / `reasoning_panel_focused` — every scroll
  input targets the conversation. `main.rs::apply_agent_progress` owns the internal action/result records.
  Visible dots are green after success, red after failure, and orange with a
  clock-driven bright/dim blink while running. Interrupted calls remain explicitly
  incomplete. ReAct decision/execution duplicates project to one activity row.
  Screen-reader output uses plain action/result/state labels.
  User turns (`user:` prefix) render as a distinct raised prompt row with a
  compact `›` marker and turn separator. Assistant turns remain unboxed and
  use one quiet accent bullet on their first rendered line so role boundaries
  remain visible without chat bubbles. Wide terminals devote otherwise-empty
  right-side space to the Session/TODO/Last-run rail rather than imposing an
  artificial prose cutoff. The composer, one measured animated run-status
  line, and a single-row state-aware footer remain visible. The footer shows
  only controls valid for the current idle/running/menu/permission state,
  renders keys as raised keycaps, prioritizes microphone controls then Help/Restore,
  drops lower-priority chips rather than wrapping, and shares its exact
  projection with mouse hit-testing. When the rail cannot fit, the activity line
  retains a compact `TODO completed/total` summary. The conversation
  scrollbar renders only when wrapped content exceeds the viewport. Markdown
  bold/heading labels use semantic blue, inline code uses teal, and prose uses
  theme body text. Role padding is applied after cell-aware wrapping so every
  continuation keeps the same left edge; lists retain hanging indents. Render,
  scrolling and URL hit-testing share the same physical-line projection. Legacy
  full-width and asymmetric chat-bubble backgrounds are prohibited. Consecutive thinking
  and expanded tool action/result entries form one compact activity group
  without blank rows between every event; human turns retain breathing room. Submitted
  bracketed pastes remain compact `[Pasted Content N chars]` chips in the
  visible transcript while their complete text still reaches provider history.
  Mouse selection starts and ends only inside the Conversation column; sidebar
  and lower-chrome hits never become transcript selections. The interactive
  Pending vision images render as numbered `[Image #N]` attachment chips at
  the start of the Composer, matching Codex/Claude attachment UX; queuing an
  image must not add a synthetic line to conversation history. Backspace at
  the start of the editable text removes the last pending image. The chips
  are a render-only projection of the existing `pending_images` payload and
  disappear when that payload is consumed by submission.
  Multiline or 256+-character text pastes follow the same compact UX: retain
  the exact payload outside the editable line, render
  `[Pasted Content N chars]`, expand it only when Enter submits the prompt,
  and let Backspace at the editable-text origin remove the newest paste chip.
  Short single-line pastes remain directly editable.
  While an agent turn runs, slash-command results remain foreground-visible
  after the live region and asynchronous `/usage` uses its independent
  channel. Bare `/permission` reports the active mode; explicit
  `ask|read|bypass` values mutate it. During any agent or VRO turn, free-text
  Enter steers that same turn through a host-owned inbox drained at the next
  safe model boundary; it never aborts the active provider stream or tool.
  Tab submits a distinct visible FIFO follow-up that starts after the active
  turn. Ctrl+C remains the explicit cancellation path and preserves already-
  visible assistant/tool output. The activity strip reports the queue count
  and both non-cancelling gestures.
  `render_permission_modal` overlays a centered `Clear` + bordered dialog
  (`PermissionModal`/`PermissionChoice` exported from `lib.rs`) whenever
  `ViewModel::pending_permission` is set; the binary's event loop intercepts
  Tab/Left/Right (toggle focus) and Enter/Esc (submit/dismiss) while the
  modal is up and resolves through `PermissionRequest::approve` / `reject`.
  VRO-8 (PRD §8.1): `ReasoningDiagnostics` is a label-typed struct (snake_case
  strategy + kebab-case mode + lowercase risk + numeric budget fields)
  exposed via `lib.rs`. Since VRO-11.5 it renders as the ONE-line inline
  thinking header (`render_inline_header()`) — phase · strategy · mode
  (with `(override)` when the user forced it) · risk, plus a prominent
  **⚠ RISK ESCALATION** marker when risk escalated to `High`. The full
  markdown budget header (`render_header()`) remains available for hosts
  that want Depth / Branches / Models / Repairs. The binary populates
  `ViewModel.reasoning_diagnostics` before each VRO turn; `None` (the
  default) renders a plain `🧠 Thinking…` header.
- Live agent progress and terminal completion share one FIFO per-turn mpsc
  channel. Reasoning/content deltas must remain ordered, and partial content
  is projected through a bounded newest tail while running so it cannot flood
  primary chat. Terminal finalization must replace that streaming region with
  exactly one transcript copy of the assistant answer; never spawn
  independent per-delta delivery tasks.
- Shared `AgentTurnOutcome::Interrupted` is rendered and recorded as an
  explicit interrupted terminal while preserving partial assistant content,
  current plan, and conversation history; it must not become a generic failure
  or ordinary completion.
- `src/markdown.rs` — self-contained, streaming-safe markdown → ratatui
  `Line` renderer. Re-parses the buffered assistant text every frame so
  partial syntax degrades gracefully: open inline markers (`**bold` with no
  closer) render literally and unclosed fenced code blocks render the
  remainder as a styled code block. Supports bold, italics, inline code,
  fenced code blocks, ordered/unordered lists with nesting, and ATX
  headings, readable links and pipe tables. Tables wrap inside aligned columns
  when wide and stack labeled values when narrow; malformed rows remain literal.
  `src/presentation.rs` owns theme-aware lexical syntax colors and grapheme/cell
  wrapping for reports, command rows and diffs. Known source languages receive
  lexical colors; unknown languages remain literal. Diffs preserve full-row
  addition/deletion backgrounds and actual old/new line numbers when supplied;
  legacy previews never invent line numbers. Underscore emphasis is intentionally unsupported so `snake_case`
  identifiers stay intact. Pure, `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, no new
  dependency (kept the crate free of an external markdown crate's
  unsafe/MSRV risk).
- `src/mobile.rs` — credential-free bounded HTTP approval companion with
  random pairing/approval capabilities, expiry, malformed-request rejection,
  fail-closed public-bind policy, and QR rendering only for explicitly
  advertised phone-reachable URLs.
- `src/lib.rs` — public re-exports and `query_startup_view`, the single
  integration point between the TUI and the runtime registry.
- `src/lmstudio_provider.rs` — LM Studio runtime provider adapter
  (composition boundary, VRO-3.x): the `LmStudioFactory` /
  `LmStudioSession` wires the local/LAN model server as a real runtime
  provider (`ProviderFactory`, `ModelCatalog`, `ProviderSuperpowers`,
  `ProviderCredentialPort`), so it appears in `/provider` selection,
  `/model` lists the server's models, and chat dispatches through the
  standard `AgentLoop` (SSE streaming with reasoning-content telemetry for
  Qwen3/DeepSeek-R1-style local reasoning models). The binary owns the
  `reqwest::Client`; no foundational crate imports HTTP.
  PRD `provider-capability-gating` P5: the catalog fetches the verified
  native `GET /api/v1/models` schema (lmstudio-ai docs
  `1_developer/2_rest/list.md` — evidence in the PRD) into a shared cache;
  `ProviderCapabilities` are mapped ONLY from reported fields (vision /
  trained_for_tool_use / reasoning.allowed_options / max_context_length),
  unreported fields stay `Unknown` (fail-closed), and embedding models are
  skipped. Advertised superpowers derive from the cache: the model selector
  lists cached LLMs, and a thinking dial appears ONLY when the pinned model
  reports `reasoning.allowed_options` with those exact labels — the former
  unconditional `disabled/enabled/high` dial never reached the wire and is
  removed (an unbacked control is worse than an absent one).
  VRO-5.3 also ships [`ReqwestLmStudioTransport`] — a `reqwest::Client`-backed
  implementation of the `LmStudioTransport` trait port that the VRO
  `LmStudioReactAgent` uses for `next_action` calls. This is the
  composition-boundary HTTP seam for the Tool-Grounded ReAct loop; it
  mirrors the existing `LmStudioSession` request path (same 120s timeout,
  same header-map helper) and is constructed credential-free.
- `src/main.rs` — binary entry point; crossterm raw-mode + alternate-screen
  lifecycle and the interactive event loop. Delegates every transition to
  `dispatch::dispatch` so it owns no Plan Mode discipline itself. Owns the
  startup credential interception route and performs native credential-store
  calls on Tokio blocking threads before entering the conversation loop. Owns the
  credential-free `RuntimeSupervisor` and drains `SessionState.pending_reasoning`
  into the runtime `UpdateSessionReasoning` command after each dispatch (ADR 0009).
  Owns the skill-store global read layer wiring: `MemoryStores::open_default`
  roots `SkillStore` at `AGENT_VESPER_GLOBAL_MEMORY_ROOT` (default
  `~/.agent-vesper/memory`, resolved via `USERPROFILE`/`HOME`; missing root
  disables the layer). Owns the hosted skill tool surface: `read_skill`
  accepts optional `section`/`offset`/`limit`; `learn_skill` writes
  frontmatter (name/description + optional `environments`/`requires_tools`/
  `tasks`) with oracle-bounded inputs (500/12,000 chars).
  Phase 6 (ADR 0010): also owns the multi-turn `vesper_agent::AgentLoop` bridge —
  `build_agent_loop`, `spawn_agent_turn` (background `tokio::spawn`), and the
  non-blocking `drain_agent_event` / `apply_agent_event` result handlers.
  Free-text prompts in NORMAL phase spawn the loop; a model-authored plan
  drives `PLANNING → REVIEW` via `dispatch::apply_model_plan`. `TuiSession`
  owns conversation history and receives the updated history from each turn,
  keeping successive prompts in one provider-visible context. The complete
  36-name hosted Python tool surface is advertised by the shared `vesper-harness`
  `ToolService`:
  memory/skills, cron, session-context search, bounded semantic inspection,
  transactional patch sets, batch reads, workflows, signed plugins, and
  provider-backed delegate/worktree workers share the same composition roots.
  Phase 8 (ADR 0011): the shared harness owns the model-facing `MemoryStores`;
  the TUI retains its slash-command projection bundle
  (`MemoryStore` + `SkillStore` + `UserProfile` + `AwarenessLedger`) and the
  `drain_memory_op` executor that turns `SessionState.pending_memory_op`
  into durable reads/writes after each dispatch.
  Phase 9 (ADR 0012): the shared harness owns model-facing cron/session
  services; the TUI owns the slash-command `CheckpointStores` bundle
  (`CheckpointsLedger` + `SessionLineage` + `CronRegistry` +
  `SessionExporter` + `ClipboardPort`; `CiStatusReader` is process-scoped)
  and the `drain_checkpoint_op` executor that turns
  `SessionState.pending_checkpoint_op` into durable snapshots / restores /
  lineage / cron / export / clipboard / CI-status operations after each
  dispatch. The Errno-24-prevention discipline lives entirely in
  `vesper-checkpoints` (RAII file-handle scoping; no SQLite, no git refs).
  Phase 10 (ADR 0013): the shared harness owns model-facing MCP/plugin
  gateways; the TUI owns the slash-command `McpStores` bundle (`McpRegistry` +
  `PluginLoader` + `TrustedPublishers`) and the `drain_mcp_op` executor
  that turns `SessionState.pending_mcp_op` into MCP server list/add/
  remove/tools and plugin list/publishers/verify/load/trust operations.
  The No-Leak Guarantee lives entirely in `vesper-mcp`
  (`#[cfg(debug_assertions)]` gates `load_unsigned_debug`; release builds
  structurally erase the method).
  VRO-5.3 (PRD §11.6): wires the Tool-Grounded ReAct loop into the
  composition boundary. The dispatch block in `drive_loop` profiles each
  prompt; when the strategy is `ToolGroundedReact` AND a real
  `LmStudioReactAgent` bundle is available (LM Studio settings configured),
  it routes through `spawn_vro_react_turn` → `VroOrchestrator::execute_react`
  (live tool-grounded loop) instead of `spawn_vro_turn` → `execute` (the
  GVR baseline). The decision is factored into the pure
  `react_dispatch_for(strategy, react_available)` helper for
  unit-testability. `build_vro_react_bundle` constructs the
  `LmStudioReactAgent` (from persisted LM Studio settings +
  `LMSTUDIO_API_KEY` env) and a `RegistryToolInvoker` over a fresh
  `ToolRegistry::parity_default()` (sharing the same `TuiToolService` Arc
  as the direct path) plus the same shared `ApprovalBroker` Arc, so the
  React path honors the same hosted-tool surface and one-time approval
  semantics as the direct `AgentLoop`. The agent_tools + approval_port Arcs
  are cloned in `run()` BEFORE they are moved into the AgentLoop and passed
  to `drive_loop` for this purpose.
  Live trajectory rendering (directive 3): both the `ReactAgent` and the
  `ToolInvoker` are wrapped in `TrajectoryCapturingReactAgent` /
  `TrajectoryCapturingInvoker` decorators that share one
  `mpsc::UnboundedSender<String>` and stream each Action/Observation/Finish
  as a pre-formatted markdown line. The event loop drains the receiver via
  `drain_trajectory(session)` each iteration (alongside
  `drain_agent_event`) and appends to `session.live_trajectory` (VRO-11.4),
  which the transcript renderer surfaces INLINE in the Conversation panel
  as the loop runs. The per-entry formatters (`format_react_action_entry` /
  `format_react_observation_entry` / `format_react_finish_entry`) are the
  live path; `format_react_trajectory` is the canonical bulk-render utility
  (exercised by tests, reserved for future bulk-render use cases).
  VRO-11.3 (UX Hotfix): four surgical TUI patches closing the dashboard-test
  gaps. **(1) Bracketed Paste Mode** — `enter_raw_mode` /
  `leave_raw_mode` queue `EnableBracketedPaste` / `DisableBracketedPaste`
  alongside the existing mouse-capture commands, and the main event loop
  handles `Event::Paste(text)` as a single contiguous insertion at the
  composer cursor (NOT as individual `Char` / `Enter` events, which would
  shatter multi-line clipboard content into premature submissions on the
  first embedded `\n`). The paste is swallowed while the permission modal
  is up so the user cannot type behind the dialog. **(2) Live Tool
  Telemetry** — `format_react_executing_entry(name)` emits
  `⏳ *Executing* \`<name>\`...` to the trajectory channel BEFORE
  `TrajectoryCapturingInvoker` awaits `inner.invoke`, so the Reasoning
  panel mirrors Codex / Claude Code's "the agent is acting" affordance
  instead of freezing during a slow tool call; the matching Observation /
  Error line streams second. **(3) Autocomplete Disconnect** — the
  `/reasoning` argument surface is no longer aliased to `/thinking` in the
  palette UI. `command_palette_candidates` short-circuits `/reasoning`
  through the pure `reasoning_argument_candidates` helper, which surfaces
  the six PRD §8.1 VRO modes (`set mode=auto|fast|balanced|deep|maximum|off`)
  + `clear` instead of the GLM thinking-style levels (`disabled`/`enabled`/
  `high`/`max`). The legacy `"/reasoning" => "thinking"` match arm in the
  fallback is removed. The `ORACLE_COMMAND_SURFACE` description for
  `reasoning` and the `help_text` line both drop the "Alias for /thinking"
  text. The BACKEND `superpower_alias("reasoning") => "thinking"` fall-through
  for `/reasoning <level>` is intentionally preserved (README-documented
  backward compat) — only the autocomplete surface changes. **(4)
  VesperLens file-save interceptor** — see `lens_integration.rs` in
  `vesper-agent`; the TUI's `execute_react` call site inherits the
  interceptor transparently because `VroOrchestrator::execute_react` wraps
  its `invoker` argument with `LensObservingInvoker` when a `LensReviewPort`
  is configured (zero-cost when not).
  **VRO-11.4 (Local Recon & UX Overhaul)**: four architectural course-
  corrections driven by architectural analysis.
  **(1) Collapsible Inline Telemetry** — tool execution logs are owned by the
  main Conversation canvas rather than the Reasoning sidebar, but normal chat
  projects them as a single `Ran N tools` summary. Ctrl+T exposes the raw log
  and works after completion, preventing either telemetry floods or lost run
  history.
  A new `TuiSession.live_trajectory: Vec<String>` field collects per-turn
  tool telemetry from both the direct path (`AgentProgressEvent::ToolStarted`
  / `ToolFinished` → `> 🛠️ Executing: <name>...` / `> ✓ <name>`) and the
  ReAct trajectory stream (`drain_trajectory` → `> ⏳ *Executing* ...`).
  The ViewModel's `transcript_lines_for` owns both compact and expanded
  projections. The field is cleared only when a new turn starts alongside
  `reasoning`, so the completed run remains inspectable.
  **(2) Explicit `request_human_review` tool** — the implicit
  `LensObservingInvoker` (VRO-11.3 directive 4) is DELETED. VesperLens
  review is now triggered by an EXPLICIT tool the model calls when it wants
  human review, matching the explicit-invocation pattern (explicit CLI
  invocation, no magic interception). The `TuiToolService` gains an
  optional `lens_review: Option<Arc<dyn LensReviewPort>>` + `lens_url_tx`
  channel. When configured, `definitions()` advertises
  `request_human_review(file_path)` (ReadOnly, blocks until the human
  submits). The tool confines an HTML file to the primary workspace, routes it
  through `LensReviewPort::review_file`, and returns `feedback_as_context_message` as
  the tool result. The `on_url` callback sends the review URL through the
  channel → `drain_lens_urls` → `live_trajectory` so the user sees
  `[VesperLens] Artifact ready for review. Open: <URL>` inline in the
  Conversation panel. **(3) Explicit ownership** — the lens port is always
  constructed for `TuiToolService`; ADR 0020 removed the dormant
  `VroOrchestrator` final-output seam. **(4)
  `LensReviewPort` trait signature** — `on_url` is now tied to the `'a`
  lifetime of `&self` (was elided) so concrete impls like `VesperLensPort`
  can call `on_url` from within the returned async block (needed because
  `VesperLens::review_artifact` calls `on_url` mid-async when the TCP
  listener binds).
  Zero-breakage: when LM Studio is NOT configured or the strategy is
  anything other than `ToolGroundedReact`, the existing direct / GVR /
  parallel-candidates paths are completely unchanged.
  **VRO-11.5 (Claude Code UI & prompt enforcement)**: (1) **tool-execution
  enforcement** — `build_agent_loop` now ALWAYS appends the
  `tool_enforcement_instruction()` system instruction (after project
  instructions + the optional cognition instruction): artifact-generation
  requests MUST execute `write_file` within the same turn;
  `request_human_review` is conditional, workspace-confined, and HTML-only;
  plan-only yielding is forbidden; Plan
  mode keeps the `update_plan` carve-out. Every path sharing the loop
  (direct, GVR, parallel candidates, tree search, PCA) sees the mandate —
  this is the behavioral patch for the 180s zero-tool turn. (2) **telemetry
  glyphs** — `apply_agent_progress` formats `ToolStarted` as `> ⏺ <name>`
  and `ToolFinished` as `> ⎿ ✓/✗ <name>` (Claude Code parity). (3) **input
  wiring** — Tab with an empty composer is a no-op (the panel-focus toggle
  died with the Reasoning panel); PageUp/PageDown/Home/End and the mouse
  wheel always scroll the conversation; F2 / `toggle_thinking` toggles the
  inline-thinking visibility carried by `panels.reasoning`.
  **VRO-11.6 (review UX parity)**: (1) internal telemetry records use the Claude
  Code shapes — `⏺ <tool>` action (flush-left) / `  ⎿ ✓/✗ <tool>` result
  (indented); the `> ` quote prefix is gone and `drain_trajectory` pushes
  entries AS-IS; the ReAct formatters (`format_react_*`) emit the same
  glyphs. (2) The VesperLens URL announcement sends TWO lines — the
  `[VesperLens] …` message and the **bare URL on its own line** (own-line
  URLs are what terminals auto-linkify; wrapped mid-sentence URLs are
  not); `drain_lens_urls` stashes it on `TuiSession.last_lens_url` and
  sets a "Ctrl+O opens it" status hint. **Ctrl+O** (`open_last_lens_review`
  + pure `lens_opener_command`: `xdg-open` / macOS `open` / Windows
  `cmd /C start`) is the guaranteed browser opener; failures surface the
  copyable URL in the status line. Bare-URL lines remain cyan + underlined.
  Chronological semantic activity rendering supersedes the legacy dim rows.
  **VRO-11.7 (clickability + TODO restore)**: (1) `enter_raw_mode(enable_mouse)`
  honors the `native_mouse` preference at every call site. (2) **single URL** — the `on_url`
  announcement no longer embeds the URL inside the message line (v0.20.36
  rendered it twice, neither clickable); it sends one message line plus
  ONE bare-URL line. The later VRO-11.11 layout contract moves live TODO
  state out of transcript history and into the dedicated sidebar panel.
  **VRO-11.9 (wheel + click parity)**: the 11.7 OFF-default killed the
  mouse wheel — in the alternate screen terminals deliver NO wheel events
  to apps unless mouse reporting is enabled (PageUp/Down kept working
  because they are key events). `native_mouse` is therefore **ON by
  default again**, and clickability moved INTO the app: `drive_loop`
  stashes each frame's `ViewModel` on `TuiSession.last_model`;
  `handle_mouse_click` reconstructs the transcript `Rect` (header 1 /
  bottom chrome menu+6 / working-tree 10 / sidebar width split) and calls
  the pure `ui::bare_url_entry_at_row` — an inverse mapping through the
  same render+wrap pipeline — so a click on a bare-URL line opens the
  browser via `open_url_in_browser` regardless of terminal link support.
  Ctrl+O remains. **Browser-stdio isolation**: `lens_opener_command`
  attaches `Stdio::null()` to stdin/stdout/stderr — the launched
  browser's own stderr (Chromium `atom_cache` / GCM `DEPRECATED_ENDPOINT`
  lines) previously inherited the TUI's stdio and sprayed over the
  alternate screen, corrupting the display on Ctrl+O.
  **VRO-11.8**: (1) `AgentProgressEvent::ToolStarted` carries a `hint`
  and `ToolFinished` a `note` — derived by the pure
  `vesper_agent::tool_arg_hint` (whitelisted arg keys only:
  path/pattern/command/…, 48-char cap or 512 for commands; NEVER
  content/body/credential keys; known credential patterns scrubbed) and `tool_result_note` (success = size digest "N lines"/"N chars",
  failure = first line of the harness error, 72-char cap) — so telemetry
  renders rich (`⏺ write_file · dashboard.html` /
  `  ⎿ ✓ write_file · 43 lines`) with bounded summaries. Shell results additionally expose the shared bounded,
  ANSI-stripped, known-credential-scrubbed excerpt in direct and ReAct paths;
  read-file results retain size summaries. Both ACP and TUI receive the shared
  excerpt and true exit/timeout outcome; terminal colors, blinking, wrapping and
  diff painting are host-specific because ACP editors own their rendering. (2) The
  enforcement instruction now mandates `update_plan` TODO tracking for
  multi-step tasks in EVERY mode (the Plan-mode-exception wording
  discouraged Code-mode plans — the live-test root cause of the missing
  TODO block). (3) ADR 0020 supersedes the same-document watchdog with trusted
  outer chrome and a sandbox-only annotation SDK, so artifact DOM rebuilds
  cannot remove or impersonate verdict controls.
  **VRO-11.11 (interactive handoff + planning interview):** VesperLens
  review URLs now open in the system browser automatically; the bare URL,
  click handling, and Ctrl+O remain fallbacks. Artifact review starts in
  interaction mode so native page controls work; annotation capture is an
  explicit toggle, `Action::Modify` has a real Send changes action, draft
  notes survive panel rerenders, and non-2xx feedback submissions fail
  visibly. The TUI advertises `request_human_input(title, questions)` beside
  `request_human_review`: it renders 1–12 escaped free-text/radio/checkbox
  questions under the active `/interview-limit` policy, requires every
  answer, blocks on the same loopback Lens port,
  and returns stable question/value pairs as tool context. TODO snapshots no
  longer enter chat history; the dedicated sidebar panel owns current plan
  state and the former full-height Run gauge is a compact status/report.
  **ADR 0020 review hardening:** trusted outer chrome owns verdicts; artifacts
  run in a no-same-origin iframe, feedback is session-authenticated, repeated
  file rounds reuse one live URL, sibling assets are confined, drafts survive
  reload, and annotations include exact range metadata plus editable suggested
  HTML. Layout warnings are passive and reviewer-selected. Both checked-in
  Playwright flows are required release evidence.
  VRO-8 (PRD §8.1 — UX & Diagnostics): three pure helpers + the wiring
  that surfaces VRO telemetry to the driver. (1) `compute_reasoning_diagnostics`
  reads only `VroOrchestrator::profile` (deterministic, allocation-only) +
  `ReasoningBudget::for_mode`; it never calls `execute*`, never mutates the
  orchestrator, and never names a concrete provider. It honors
  `SessionState.reasoning_mode_override` so a `/reasoning set mode=deep`
  override is reflected in the panel header **before** the next turn runs.
  The result is stashed on `TuiSession.reasoning_diagnostics` and projected
  into `ViewModel.reasoning_diagnostics` each frame. (2) `strategy_snake_case` /
  `mode_label_kebab` / `risk_label_lowercase` map the domain enums to the
  exact PRD §10.3 / §8.1 / §14.2 wire labels so the panel header matches the
  JSON shape byte-for-byte. (3) `format_learning_extraction_notice` renders
  the **✓ LEARNED** notice pushed through the trajectory channel after a
  successful VRO turn — **symmetric across both spawn paths** (audit fix):
  `spawn_vro_react_turn` (ReAct) and `spawn_vro_turn` (GVR / parallel
  candidates / tree search / PCA) both emit it when the outcome status is
  `Succeeded` and at least one model call was issued. It is purely
  presentational; the actual VRO-7 procedural-memory persistence happens in
  `VroOrchestrator::execute_with_learning`, which is unchanged. The override
  is honored in three wiring sites: the `should_vro` route check uses
  `effective_reasoning_mode()` (so `Off` routes through the direct
  `AgentLoop`); both VRO request constructors
  (`spawn_vro_turn`, `spawn_vro_react_turn`) set `ReasoningRequest.mode` to
  the effective mode so the orchestrator's budget preset matches the
  user's choice.

## Local Contracts

- Provider request controls are projected only from the active registry
  superpower surface. Hidden controls from a previous authentication mode are
  cleared before dispatch rather than sent as stale provider configuration.
- `integration-test-harness` may redirect xAI to a loopback endpoint solely for
  process-level composition tests; normal builds contain no such route.

- MCP discovery, browser presets and deferred calls retain one conversation
  owner through direct/VRO/ReAct registries built by `build_hosted_registry`.
  Hosted advertisement and execution use the active provider identity; the TUI
  composes the Z.ai adapter's credential source into the MCP resolver without
  copying secrets into server configuration.
  Loading another transcript resets MCP before changing conversation identity;
  a busy owner refuses the switch. Exit drops the owner (ADR 0031).
  `mcp_tui_wrapped_registry_retains_the_session_gateway` checks wrapper wiring.

- Voice latency optimization must preserve Alex's selected model/reasoning unless
  separately changed by the user. Native NPU support is requested for BOTH STT
  and TTS, with independent backend/model/offload/quality gates and CPU kept usable.
  Detection is not inference support; setup/activation must be native Settings,
  consented, verified, and preserve existing runtimes/workloads. Current NPU
  evidence and open gates live in `docs/foundation/voice-first-speech-and-npu-assessment.md`.
  Clarified-R16 selection policy is enforced by `voice_accel.rs` + the pure-core
  `vesper_voice::execution` resolver: per-stage CPU / Automatic-verified-only /
  strict-NPU; CPU policy never consults the accelerator registry (zero calls);
  Automatic-choosing-CPU is an ordinary outcome; strict refusals name the stage
  blocker and the Settings action; readiness facts are evidence-based and cached
  in-process only. No NPU route is registered until a real adapter passes its
  gate — the strict menu option stays hidden, never decorative. Evidence:
  `docs/foundation/voice-capability-gated-execution.md`.

- The playback player argv must NOT request fatal-error behavior
  (`--fatal-errors`): the player's documented default recovers device xruns,
  while the flag aborts mid-stream — under per-piece feeding that killed the
  child during starvation gaps and surfaced as EPIPE on the next piece
  (Alex's repeated-turn failure). A pipe-write failure means the child died
  first: preserve the original io error (kind + OS code) with the truthful
  consequence text, never an invented device hypothesis. A failed stream is
  contained (remaining pieces fail fast; next turn opens a fresh child), and
  exit 0 before our stdin close is a short-consumer failure, never `Drained`.
  Evidence: `docs/foundation/voice-multiturn-playback-repair.md`.

- Preview and F9 share ONE execution-policy rule: the Natural Voice pack screen
  resolves the TTS stage through `voice_accel::preview_policy_gate` (the same
  shared `stage_route_for_policy` the F9 gate uses) against the visible draft,
  refuses identically under strict policy, and never saves the draft. Pack-screen
  rows and action handlers derive from one ordered `PackAction` list — never
  recompute indexes by hand (an off-by-one made Preview fire Repair; caught by
  the PTY loop, not unit tests). `ConversationHost::reload_engine_selection`
  sends `Replace` only on a real selection change: a no-op or voice-only save
  must not bump the speech generation or rebuild the acoustic engine. Production
  loop evidence and the interruption/lifecycle suites:
  `docs/foundation/voice-cpu-production-acceptance.md`.

- Speech sentence delivery overlaps successor synthesis with current playback
  through a rendezvous handoff carrying a BOUNDED TWO-UNIT bank
  (`sync_channel::<PreparedSpeech>(2)`, D25 boundary repair — depth 1 is
  derived-insufficient and depth 0 serialized the producer behind the lane's
  write+drain, landing uncovered slow successors as dead air); do not
  reintroduce serial synthesis/drain pauses or unbounded ahead-of-playback
  buffering. Hygiene-approved units split
  losslessly: the FIRST piece targets 28 characters at a genuine clause boundary
  (word fallback, honestly reported) protecting acoustic onset, and SUCCESSORS are
  sentence-level — one whole sentence per inference within the 510-phoneme-ID
  context budget, with the bounded clause/word fallback for over-budget
  sentences. (Supersedes the historical 28/48 micro-cut policy: per-piece model
  fade quiet stacked 0.25–0.46 s per side at every artificial mid-sentence cut —
  7.2 s inserted silence in a 41 s passage — versus 2.9 s at natural sentence
  boundaries under the sentence-level policy. Very short units stay whole.) One
  player stream, cumulative byte receipts and exactly
  one terminal outcome remain attached to the original segment. Prepared canonical
  PCM is capped at 16 MiB per piece (adapter allocations are separate). Stop and selection
  replacement invalidate queued/prepared audio and serialize with stream admission,
  never blocking pipe writes or drain waits. Stale work cannot reopen the player;
  fresh generations recover normally. Independent synthesis/player stage clocks
  and the upstream speakable-text wait status distinguish local work from agent
  waiting without claiming acoustic onset or assigning all waiting to the provider.
  This is terminal audio composition; ACP has no device-playback owner.

- Kokoro edge cleanup is limited to short hygiene units (at most 64
  characters), where the model's fixed leading/trailing padding dominates the
  reply and caused the reproduced hiccup. Neural PCM keeps 50 ms at artificial
  piece joins and 100 ms per side at real sentence joins; the first onset stays
  intact. Long units retain their full envelope and synthesis-cover margin,
  system speech is untouched, and wholly quiet/very-soft PCM fails safe without
  trimming. Evidence: `docs/foundation/voice-short-reply-quality-repair.md`.

- Voice latency is an explicit user requirement: F9 recording must not wait for
  Python import/probing or inference-session load. Start an existing backend
  sidecar concurrently with capture; prepare Kokoro on the speech worker.
  Enabled neural voice gets read-only background integrity preflight at terminal
  startup; unchanged assets use the bounded verified-identity cache. The Natural
  Voice pack screen owns one reusable Preview worker that prepares while its menu
  is visible and serves repeat previews without reconstructing the runtime; leaving
  the screen drops it. Cold/changed assets still require full verification. Measure recorder onset and first PCM
  separately from real transcription/provider/audio latency; do not claim instant
  replies from fixture timings. Missing setup and recorder failures stay visible.
- Managed capture space checks use the portable filesystem API and accept a
  not-yet-created data root by measuring its nearest existing ancestor. Only
  absence allows ascent; unknown space or permission failures still refuse
  capture before allocation. Lease recovery uses Linux process-start identity
  when available; other platforms retain a live PID conservatively and reclaim
  only a PID proved absent. Every capture directory uses a UUID identity so
  back-to-back captures cannot alias within one clock tick.

- Playback drains player stderr concurrently and classifies only the first 4096
  bytes into static actionable diagnostics; raw stderr never enters chat. Error
  classification is not proof of device health or audibility.

- F9 is host-owned speech delivery through the saved engine/voice, with the
  substantive answer retained in chat. `src/voice_turn_instruction.rs` describes
  that contract only on voice turns; it forbids model-authored shell speech or
  alternate-engine substitution. It is instruction, not a shell security filter.
  Direct/VRO inherit the turn configuration; ReAct receives the same voice-only
  context. ACP has no F9/playback owner: this is a justified terminal-only
  exclusion, not a new model tool or shared cognition behavior.
- VRO-17 R6 binds one production F9 gesture through
  `ConversationHost::apply_conversation_gesture`. Speaking with no active
  recorder delegates directly to the session-owned genuine `BargeIn`
  transition: urgent playback flush + speech-worker generation invalidation,
  one transactional runtime-cancel request, and immediate replacement capture.
  The TUI must not synthesize this as `StopRequested` + `CaptureStarted` or
  require a second F9. Explicit `cancel_turn`/Ctrl+C routes active speech
  through `InterruptionControl::Stop` (same urgent stop and transactional
  cancel, no capture); outside active voice speech the generic Ctrl+C path is
  unchanged. Interruption context is staged by the session at most once.
  Production-entry evidence: `tests/voice_r6_binding.rs`; execution record:
  `docs/foundation/voice-r6-binding-repair.md`.
- F9-origin capture transcription runs through the *selected* STT adapter:
  `voice.rs`'s worker carries a conversation-STT slot the F9 gate fills from
  `SelectedStt::build()` (the composed FLM NPU route when the saved scope and
  per-process verification admit it; the shared CPU sidecar instance
  otherwise — one recognizer per process either way). A conversation-origin
  `Control::Stop` transcribes via that adapter and never spawns or consults a
  second CPU sidecar; the CPU path stays acceleration-blind. The shared
  sidecar's interpreter resolution honors the same `VESPER_PYTHON_PATH` /
  `GLM_VENV_PATH` / installed-venv precedence as dictation F5
  (`shared_voice_python`; the silent drop of that precedence was the
  FLM-session regression the legacy PTY loop caught). Settings' readiness
  lines resolve through the shared `execution_rows` rule and report
  requested policy, availability, next-request route and the real
  last-request receipt as separate facts; "using" is never claimed from a
  static picture.
- Settings calls optional partial STT output a **Live transcript preview**.
  A final-only recognizer says the preview is not supported and explicitly
  confirms that final text still appears after Stop; it never labels speech
  recognition itself unavailable. The saved future-capability preference is
  preserved and the R4 provider-capability gate remains authoritative.
- Streamed and terminal-only voice answers feed the same hygiene gate, without
  replaying streamed answers on completion. Speech failures remain visible in
  chat; pipe writes never imply playback completion. Worker admission is bounded
  to 32 units of at most 8192 bytes; queued jobs retain their enqueue generation.
  Playback control locks must not span blocking pipe writes or drain waits.
  Speech Stop suppresses later units for that reply without losing its text;
  a new voice turn clears the suppression.

- OpenAI account models refresh after native authentication and when reopening
  Settings. Render from the bounded result, use an available default for a fresh
  surface, retain explicit selections for validation, and reject unavailable choices
  before dispatch. Failed or empty discovery shows its safe reason and a clickable
  Retry model list row (Enter/R retry, Esc back), never a blank command input.
  Preserve discovery diagnostics separately from transient command-menu notices;
  successful retry refreshes both the surface and session policy.
  The adapter snapshot also guards workers; no account lookup runs inside rendering.
  Spark selection must use its adapter-owned 128K context budget.

- ADR 0028/0029 `acceptance_host` retains explicit controls; the central Settings
  draft exposes ON/OFF with automatic PRD enrollment and no required path field. `/acceptance` uses shared harness controls. Direct,
  VRO, ReAct and Swarm composition retains the parent gate; candidate/Finish prose
  cannot replace its report. Cancellation displays incomplete scope. Native settings and
  event tests enforce presentation parity with ACP.
  Objective enrollment uses the current validated model and reasoning configuration.
  `activate_for_prompt` captures the original request for independent scope review.
  LM Studio transport uses the selected request model in both hosts. TUI execution
  takes changed local-model context windows from its adapter snapshot, never the
  launch model's window.

- The opt-in web surface uses the shared harness web service and its contained
  fetch/render/browser runtime, off the render thread. No TUI-specific driver
  or network fallback exists; deployment is documented in `docs/web-tools.md`.

- Native plans share the agent loop's four-segment bounded autonomous
  continuation with ACP. Each submitted turn seeds the loop from the retained
  task panel, so a resume turn cannot accept acknowledgement text as completion
  while older plan items remain open. If the ultimate cap is reached, status,
  transcript, telemetry, and worker rendering must identify the stop rather
  than imply completion.
- The LM Studio-backed Tool-Grounded ReAct adviser may receive bounded prior
  conversation context only when LM Studio is also the acting provider. For a
  different acting provider it receives the current request only; compaction
  must never widen that established disclosure into cross-provider transcript
  disclosure.
- The optional per-turn iteration cap defaults to disabled. `/max-iterations
  enable` restores 50, `/max-iterations disable` removes the user cap, and an
  explicit `1-1000` sets it; none of these removes the ultimate safety ceiling.

- Stdout carries only terminal escapes via crossterm; no ACP/JSON-RPC may
  appear there. Tracing goes to stderr only.
- The crate depends on `vesper-auth`, `vesper-domain`, `vesper-provider`,
  `vesper-provider-glm`, `vesper-runtime`,
  `vesper-agent` (Phase 6 / ADR 0010: the binary composes the multi-turn
  agent loop), `vesper-memory` (Phase 8 / ADR 0011: the binary owns the
  durable memory store bundle), `vesper-checkpoints` (Phase 9 / ADR
  0012: the binary owns the durable checkpoint/session-lineage/cron/
  export/clipboard/CI bundle), and `vesper-mcp` (Phase 10 / ADR 0013:
  the binary owns the durable MCP-registry + Ed25519-signed plugin
  loader bundle), `vesper-sessions` for bounded persisted transcript search,
  and `vesper-observability` for opt-in telemetry, plus `vesper-harness` for
  the shared hosted tool implementation; it must not depend on
  `vesper-acp`, SQLite, or any disposable spike.
  `vesper-provider-synthetic` is dev-only and may never be selected by a
  production binary.
- The Plan Mode state machine is **pure**: no I/O, no async, no global
  state. Every transition returns a `PlanTransition`; the event loop applies
  it.
- Plan Mode reasoning text is produced by the model through the runtime; the
  TUI owns the transition discipline, not the reasoning.
- The crate stays `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` and respects workspace MSRV
  1.88, workspace lints, and `-D warnings` Clippy.
- ADR 0009: the GLM reasoning surface is the single `/thinking` dial
  (`{disabled, enabled, high, max}`); `/effort` is retired. `dispatch` stays
  pure and produces `SessionState.pending_reasoning` for any resolved
  `zai:reasoning` superpower; the binary's async loop applies it to the
  runtime. The GLM `reasoning_mode_for_superpower` mapper lives in
  `vesper-provider-glm`.
- Superpower commands (`/thinking`, `/model`) are resolved
  dynamically against the active provider's advertised descriptors at
  dispatch time, so the same command surface works for any registered
  provider.
- PRD `provider-capability-gating` — **dynamic capability gating**:
  provider feature controls are advertisement- and capability-driven, never
  name-checked. `/settings` rows and value palettes derive from the active
  provider's advertised `SuperpowerDescriptor`s (by `command_alias`),
  narrowed by its `SuperpowerPolicy::valid_choices` for the active plan +
  model; a provider that does not advertise a control hides it. Image
  paste, mixture-of-agents advisers, and auxiliary eligibility consult the
  session's `ModelCapabilityIndex` (built at the composition boundary for
  the active provider) and fail closed. No frontend path may call a
  concrete provider's catalog or match on a provider id; concrete adapters
  appear only in composition wiring (`register_default_providers`,
  `provider_configuration_for`, `capability_index_for`).
- Mutating agent tools run under the injected one-time `ApprovalBroker`; the
  TUI displays one pending request and resolves it only on `/approve` or
  `/cancel`. A closed channel fails closed. `@file`, `@folder`, `@diff`, and
  `@symbol` references are expanded under the workspace with untrusted
  delimiters and bounded sensitive-file filtering.
- Persisted TUI search uses the bounded `vesper-sessions` linear search port;
  its projection contains only user/assistant text and is atomically
  replaced. SQLite/FTS indexes are intentionally absent.
- `/compact [focus]` invokes the shared semantic compactor asynchronously;
  it never hides or deletes the human-visible transcript. Direct and VRO
  turns auto-compact at the shared token-pressure threshold using the selected
  model's catalog window. Persisted state separates display transcript from
  provider-working history and retains pressure, latest report, and bounded
  quality lineage; a 15-point coverage regression is surfaced visibly.
- `AGENT_VESPER_TELEMETRY` opt-in enables the secret-safe trajectory recorder;
  prompts, tool payloads, reasoning, paths, commands, and credentials are
  excluded from JSONL events.
- Provider selection first uses the saved preference under `AGENT_VESPER_HOME`
  (default `.agent-vesper`), then `AGENT_VESPER_PROVIDER`, then `zai`.
- Missing or locally malformed required credentials route to the Agent
  Vesper Authentication screen before the main loop. Environment credentials retain precedence; new
  stored credentials use the OS credential manager with the documented
  owner-only Unix vault fallback. No live provider call is made by startup
  validation.
- Auth is provider-routed: the `AuthProvider` is projected from each
  provider's advertised `ProviderFactory::descriptor()` (env var via
  `secret_reference_fields[0]`, `key_url`) through the registry and
  `StartupView.auth`. The TUI holds no hardcoded provider match arms. A
  provider-routed `/auth` slash command (`UiAction::OpenAuth` →
  `SessionState.pending_reauth`) re-opens the screen mid-session. Storage
  (`vesper-auth`) and per-adapter resolution are unchanged.

## Work Guidance

- `/usage` uses the registered session's neutral usage port on its independent
  channel and renders the shared clean aligned status panel without interrupting an
  active turn. No GLM-only quota branch or host-owned quota parser is allowed.
  OpenAI model-specific reasoning policy filters menus and repairs incompatible
  selections when the model changes; API/subscription modes remain distinct.
- OpenAI is one native provider with API-key and ChatGPT device sign-in
  choices in Settings → Providers and `/auth`. Method selection, login,
  cancellation, secure save, and local logout are registry-port driven;
  device sign-in never launches Codex. Every interactive challenge retains its
  complete HTTPS URL: device login requests browser launch, shows verification
  link/code, and keeps Enter retry and C copy usable after launch failure.
  A launch request never claims browser authentication succeeded. The provider preference applies after
  restart; model and reasoning selections drive the next shared agent turn.
  Provider switching checks credential presence without forcing the auth menu:
  a valid stored API key or subscription session is reused when returning to
  OpenAI. Explicit `/auth` remains the route for rotation or replacement.
- OpenAI catalog metadata supplies vision gates and compaction budgets.
  OpenAI memory extraction uses the same native credential/Responses path;
  it never needs a Z.ai key. Embeddings remain independently configured.

- Keep the Plan Mode, command registry, superpower adapter, dispatch surface,
  and renderer trait unit-testable without touching a real terminal — the
  production binary is the only module that may invoke crossterm directly.
- Keep Auth Hub provider choices registry-driven. Do not render aspirational
  providers, models, plans, endpoints, or authentication methods.
- The composer must expose the registered oracle commands while the input
  begins with `/`: the binary owns palette selection/completion key handling,
  while `CommandRegistry::completion_candidates` remains pure and derives its
  labels/descriptions from `ORACLE_COMMAND_SURFACE`. The palette must make the
  complete registry reachable through a scrolling viewport; Enter submits the
  highlighted command, while configurable commands first expand into values
  advertised by the active provider and free-form commands leave the cursor at
  their argument position. Tab completes without submitting.
- All event-loop transition logic lives in `dispatch::dispatch`. When a new
  command or transition is added, extend `CommandOutcome` in `commands.rs`,
  add a `match` arm in `dispatch::apply_outcome`, and cover the lifecycle in
  `dispatch::integration_tests`. The binary's event loop must never grow its
  own transition discipline.
- ADR 0010 (Tier C Phase 5): `/review` is **retired**. The model now drives
  `PLANNING → REVIEW` by emitting the `update_plan` tool; the agent loop
  surfaces the plan (`AgentTurnOutcome::plan`) and the binary calls
  `dispatch::apply_model_plan(body)` to finalize it. The human no longer
  authors the plan body.
- ADR 0010 (Tier C Phase 6): the binary owns the multi-turn agent-loop
  bridge. Free-text prompts in NORMAL phase spawn `AgentLoop::run_prompt` in
  a background `tokio::spawn`; the event loop `try_recv`s the result each
  iteration so the UI stays responsive (a "WORKING..." banner is shown
  in-flight). A `Completed { plan: Some(body), .. }` outcome routes through
  `dispatch::apply_model_plan`. PLANNING-phase free text stays inline
  (driver answers the pending question); the loop is never spawned there.
  Construction (`build_agent_loop` / `build_agent_config`) is credential-free
  and provider-aware (GLM `zai` / `synthetic`); dispatch fails fast on
  missing credentials or unknown providers.
- ADR 0010 (Tier C Phase 7): 100% command routing parity with the Python
  oracle's `LOCAL_COMMANDS`. Every registered command resolves to a concrete
  typed handler; an accidental missing route fails as an internal parity
  violation. No deferred fallback exists. Workflow commands
  (`/security-review`, `/smart`, `/release`, `/insights`, `/diff`) build a
  prompt and stash it on `SessionState.pending_prompt`; the binary drains it
  into a background `AgentLoop` turn (same path as free-text prompts).
- ADR 0011 (Tier C Phase 8): the 13 awareness/memory commands
  (`/memory`, `/goal`, `/subgoal`, `/skills`, `/profile`, `/awareness`,
  `/metacognition`, `/deliberation`, `/repository`, `/meta-learning`,
  `/observability`, `/curator`, `/journey`) are no longer deferred. They
  resolve to `CommandOutcome::Memory(MemoryOp)`; `dispatch` records
  `SessionState.pending_memory_op`; the binary owns a `MemoryStores`
  bundle (`MemoryStore` + `SkillStore` + `UserProfile` + `AwarenessLedger`
  under `AGENT_VESPER_MEMORY_ROOT` or `.agent-vesper/memory/`) and drains
  the op synchronously after dispatch (these are local filesystem
  reads/writes — fast enough not to block the UI).
- Host-neutral command parity is declared by
  `vesper_domain::HOST_PARITY_SLASH_COMMANDS`; the TUI registry test must
  contain every shared entry. `/embedding set` replaces the live adapter and
  migrates vectors in both hosts; probing an unused adapter is not sufficient.
- ADR 0012 (Tier C Phase 9): the 13 checkpoint/session/loop/export/copy/ci
  commands (`/sessions-new`, `/sessions`, `/lineage`, `/branch`,
  `/rename`, `/checkpoint`, `/rollback`, `/rewind`, `/undo`, `/loop`,
  `/export`, `/export last`, `/copy`, `/ci`) are no longer deferred. They
  resolve to
  `CommandOutcome::Checkpoint(CheckpointOp)`; `dispatch` records
  `SessionState.pending_checkpoint_op`; the binary owns a
  `CheckpointStores` bundle (`CheckpointsLedger` + `SessionLineage` +
  `CronRegistry` + `SessionExporter` + `ClipboardPort` +
  `CiStatusReader` under `AGENT_VESPER_CHECKPOINT_ROOT` or
  `.agent-vesper/checkpoints/`) and drains the op synchronously after
  dispatch. **Errno 24 prevention:** the `vesper-checkpoints` crate uses
  strict RAII (`Drop`) file-handle discipline — no `File` is ever stored
  in a long-lived struct, no SQLite, no git refs, no auto-snapshotting.
  Checkpoints are explicit-only by structural design.
- ADR 0013 (Tier C Phase 10): the final 2 commands (`/mcp`, `/plugins`)
  are no longer deferred. They resolve to `CommandOutcome::Mcp(McpOp)`;
  `dispatch` records `SessionState.pending_mcp_op`; the binary owns an
  `McpStores` bundle (`McpRegistry` + `PluginLoader` +
  `TrustedPublishers` under `AGENT_VESPER_MCP_ROOT` or
  `.agent-vesper/mcp/`) and drains the op after dispatch. **No-Leak
  Guarantee:** `vesper-mcp`'s unsigned-plugin loading code path is
  structurally erased from `--release` builds via
  `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]`; a release binary cannot load an unsigned
  plugin by any code path. Plugins are declarative only (the
  `executable_code` permission is rejected at validation time). With
  Phase 10 shipped. The former composer, live-settings, image, sound, mobile,
  keybinding, accessibility, Vim, and terminal-integration exclusions are now
  concrete native operations. Tests iterate the complete registry and reject
  any hidden missing route.
- Clipboard image paste is an interactive-terminal-only host capability, so it
  has no ACP protocol twin. Plain Ctrl+V reads native bitmap data through the
  platform clipboard and normalizes it to PNG; terminal bracketed paste and
  clipboard text share one path-aware ingestion route so an existing
  PNG/JPEG/WebP/AVIF path is queued through the established image pipeline
  instead of being parsed as a slash command. Undocumented AVIF upload is
  prohibited: pasted AVIF files are normalized locally with ImageMagick or
  ffmpeg, while copied bitmap pixels need no external converter. Normal text,
  multiline text, and real slash commands remain composer input.
- If preserved composer/history content exceeds the active model's catalog
  capability, the TUI offers at most three same-provider, active-plan models
  with Up/Down/Enter/Esc consent. Confirming uses the existing validated
  session model-update path, then dispatches the untouched text and images;
  cancellation never silently switches or drops the composition.
- Footer and palette rows are mouse-operable while TUI mouse capture is active.
  F4 cycles bounded real Changes/Git/Diff/Files/GitHub views. `src/voice.rs`
  owns the microphone worker, recorder/sidecar processes and private temporary
  audio. `src/voice_transcribe.py` is the embedded local PCM chunk protocol.
  `src/voice_vad.py` is the persistent backend-neutral Silero VAD worker
  (canonical mono i16 16 kHz WAV in; distinct confirmed-silence result with no
  output file; speech-only canonical WAV out, atomically published; bounded
  metadata-only errors). It exists to front speech backends that have no VAD of
  their own (FLM ASR hallucinates on unfiltered silence); installed
  faster-whisper 1.2.1's `collect_chunks` returns `(audio_tuple, segments)` and
  the worker concatenates the per-segment arrays before quantization. It is not
  yet wired into production routing; evidence and the launch-gate correction
  live in `docs/foundation/voice-npu-stt-implementation-progress.md`.
  F5 and the footer toggle start/stop capture; red circle “Push to talk” becomes
  red square “Stop”. Preparing/transcribing remain cancellable and do not block
  rendering or composer input. Voice Stop is distinct from agent cancellation.
  The footer reserves microphone controls before lower-priority actions, including
  Retry/Discard on error; elapsed time appears in the status row. F5 remains
  reachable through permission and command-menu interceptors. Finish/discard voice
  work before entering nested Settings loops. Screen readers receive textual state.
  Linux uses `arecord`, macOS `afrecord`, with mono 16 kHz signed 16-bit WAV;
  unavailable devices/backends fail honestly. Windows capture remains unsupported.
  Interpreter discovery preserves explicit overrides, the harness venv, sibling
  venvs and system Python precedence. Fixed uv/python venv preparation runs only
  after voice activation, on the worker, with cancellation and bounded processes.
  Existing environments are import-probed; an incomplete venv never implies ready.
  The local faster-whisper sidecar loads once and stays warm across successful
  clips. Transcription reads 30-second PCM chunks and emits ordered progress;
  completed chunks survive retry without re-appending to the composer. There is no
  short capture timer or 90-second whole-recording deadline. Five minutes without
  real transcription progress fails with private audio retained for Retry/Discard.
  The UI appends completed dictation to existing input and never auto-sends it.
  Audio is deleted on success/discard/normal session exit. Cancellation and ordinary
  errors retain private session-local audio until explicit discard or exit. Helper
  shutdown kills/waits processes and joins the reader; POSIX process groups bound
  cancellation of preparation descendants. Abrupt process/OS death is not normal
  exit cleanup evidence. No audio/transcript is written to telemetry.
  Ctrl-Shift-C copies only app-managed mouse-selected transcript text.
- Provider catalogs and provider-specific settings belong to adapters. The
  production composition registers the real Z.ai, LM Studio, and OpenAI adapters;
  no additional provider may be advertised without its adapter and evidence.
- When adding a new slash command, register it in
  `CommandRegistry::stage_11b`, document its surface in
  `CommandRegistry::help_text`, and add a test that proves it resolves
  correctly across phases.
- When adding a new provider superpower, declare it in the provider's
  factory (e.g. `glm_superpowers` in `vesper-provider-glm::factory`); the
  TUI surfaces it automatically once the provider is registered with
  `register_with_superpowers`.
- VRO-8 (PRD §8.1 — UX & Diagnostics): the manual reasoning-mode override
  + diagnostic telemetry layer. **Contract**: a manual
  `/reasoning set mode=<X>` overrides the deterministic `TaskProfiler` for
  every subsequent VRO turn; `/reasoning clear` or `set mode=auto` returns
  to profiler defaults; bare `/reasoning` reports the current override in
  the status line. **Zero orchestrator breakage**: the TUI computes its
  own diagnostics projection (`compute_reasoning_diagnostics`) from
  `VroOrchestrator::profile` + `ReasoningBudget::for_mode`; it never calls
  `execute*`, never mutates the orchestrator, and never names a concrete
  provider. **Wiring invariant**: every VRO turn dispatch site
  (`should_vro` route check, `spawn_vro_turn`, `spawn_vro_react_turn`) must
  consult `SessionState::effective_reasoning_mode()` so the override is
  honored consistently across the direct path and both VRO paths. When a
  new dispatch site is added, route its mode through the same helper. The
  PRD §8.1 mode list is authoritative — `parse_reasoning_mode` rejects
  every invented mode with a usage error listing all six.

## Mid-Turn Submits (queued prompts + instant slash answers)

While an agent turn is running (`agent_running`): informational slash
commands keep answering instantly (dispatch is pure transcript work);
`/usage` runs on its OWN channel (`usage_rx`, drained by
`drain_usage_event`) instead of hijacking the agent channel, so the quota
answer lands mid-turn; the slash-command palette stays visible; and a
free-text prompt or workflow submit is QUEUED (`queued_prompt`) and fired
by the main loop through the shared `spawn_submitted_prompt` path the
moment the turn completes — never silently dropped, never interrupting the
work (ACP mid-turn-slash-grace parity; see `apps/agent-vesper-acp/AGENTS.md`).

## Verification

- `tui_host_registry_settles_large_command_output_and_recovers` exercises the
  real hosted TUI registry for mixed large output, truncation, timeout,
  cancellation, descendant-held pipes, and a successful following command.

- Loopback fixtures accepting from nonblocking listeners explicitly switch accepted
  streams to blocking mode before applying read timeouts; macOS may inherit the
  listener's mode. Retain bounded accept/read deadlines and wire assertions.

- `ui::output_upgrade_reference` checks report alignment and actual frame cells
  across six themes and 40/80/120 columns, including clock-driven dots and source
  line numbers. `VESPER_OUTPUT_CAPTURE_DIR` optionally writes JSON frame captures
  to an explicitly supplied temporary directory. Rendering tests stay beside source.

- Run `python3 apps/agent-vesper-tui/tests/settings_pty.py target/debug/agent-vesper-tui`
  after an all-features build on Linux/macOS. It uses isolated HOME/workspace and
  blocked outbound proxies, submits no provider prompt, and checks draft/discard,
  save/keep-editing, native toggles, execution permission and restart preferences.
- Landing tests cover navigation, shared mouse geometry, compact/tiny rendering,
  and numeric release comparisons; binary tests reject malformed or non-stable
  release metadata. Exercise startup, Settings, coding, resize, update failure,
  quit and resume in an isolated PTY without provider access or user-state writes.

- `src/swarm_host_tests.rs` is an explicit container gate: child-process-isolated
  HOME/XDG/state, asserted loopback chat endpoint, configured embeddings, both
  scope modes, three overlapping workers, native task/event and history delivery.

- Concurrent watcher/dispatch tests synchronize on an active real sweep,
  isolate their state, and join before inspecting completion; scheduler luck
  and PID-reused temporary directories are not correctness evidence.
- Run `cargo test -p agent-vesper-tui --lib`.
- Run `cargo test -p agent-vesper-tui --bins` (Phase 6 wiring:
  provider-aware config, `build_agent_loop`/`build_agent_config`, the
  `AgentEvent → SessionState` mapper, and the spawn/drain plumbing).
- Run `cargo clippy -p agent-vesper-tui --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`.
- Run `cargo run --package xtask --quiet -- architecture` (the TUI must
  appear in the validated package count and pass the dependency-direction
  gate, including the new `agent-vesper-tui → vesper-agent` edge).
- Run `cargo build -p agent-vesper-tui --bins` to confirm the binary
  links under the workspace toolchain.
- Native provider composition registers xAI alongside OpenAI, Z.ai and LM
  Studio. xAI browser login is the normal Grok-account path, with automatic
  argument-based launch from the complete structured URL, exact-link copy and
  device-code fallback; rendered wrapping never supplies the launch/copy
  payload. Authenticated model refresh, reasoning, region, transport,
  compaction and hosted-tool choices/structured values derive from provider
  descriptors/superpowers. Free-text rows remain bounded and use the normal
  Settings draft/Save/Discard flow. Voice, tools, skills, VRO and workers use
  the unchanged shared registry and AgentLoop.

## Supply-chain note

The crate pins `ratatui = "=0.30.2"` and `crossterm = "=0.29.0"` together:
- ratatui 0.29.0 pulled in `paste 1.0.15` (RUSTSEC-2024-0436 — unmaintained)
  and `lru 0.12.5` (RUSTSEC-2026-0002 — unsound `IterMut`). ratatui 0.30.2
  dropped `paste` entirely and moved to `lru 0.18.1`, eliminating both
  advisories without ignoring them.
- crossterm must be `=0.29.0` (not `=0.28.1`) so the workspace, the TUI,
  and `ratatui-crossterm 0.1.2` all share one crossterm version. The
  workspace pin keeps `default-features = false` for the minimal surface
  but explicitly enables the `windows` feature, because crossterm gates
  the `winapi`/`crossterm_winapi` backend deps behind that feature —
  without it the crate fails to compile on `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` with
  E0432/E0433 (`unresolved import crossterm_winapi`, `cannot find module
  winapi`). The Windows-only deps are target-gated so enabling `windows`
  on Linux/macOS pulls in nothing.

Do not downgrade ratatui or crossterm, and do not drop the `windows`
feature, without re-running `cargo deny check`, `cargo audit`, and the
five-target CI matrix.

- VRO-17 R3 (opt-in `voice-kokoro` feature, implies `voice-conversation`):
  the Natural Voice pack. `settings_host.rs` owns the Voice panel's
  engine selection, the pack screen (Install with the confirmed real-
  numbers dialog, real byte progress with Esc-stop, Preview through the
  real adapter + PlaybackOwner with a visible stop — never a turn, never
  the microphone, never committing the draft —, Repair/Verify that asks
  before transfers, measured ownership-safe Remove, Details with
  licenses/provenance), and the save-flow engine re-resolution.
  `voice_readiness.rs` joins pack+phonemizer checks into the ONE shared
  assessment the F9 gate and the panel both read (enabled-but-blocked
  names the prerequisite; no silent engine fallback). The adapter crate
  `vesper-voice-kokoro` owns the pack cache under
  `~/.local/share/agent-vesper/voice-pack`; the TUI never seeds or
  bypasses setup. Default/`voice-conversation`-only builds compile none
  of this and offer no install that can never work.
