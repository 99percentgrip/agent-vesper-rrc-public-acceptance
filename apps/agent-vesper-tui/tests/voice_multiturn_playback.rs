//! VRO-17 multi-turn playback pipe failure regression (red-first).
//!
//! Alex's device evidence: speech completed on the first two F9 turns, then
//! failed mid-sentence from the third turn onward, with repeated
//! `speech failed: playback failed: player pipe write failed (device closed?)`
//! warnings — under BOTH CPU and Automatic policies (the accelerator registry
//! is empty, so both resolve to CPU; no NPU evidence exists).
//!
//! §1/§2 findings this suite pins (established by source + controlled
//! experiments before the fix):
//!
//! 1. **The wrapper text is a hypothesis, not evidence.** `push_pcm`
//!    discarded the original `io::Error` (kind + OS code) and printed a
//!    generic fallback. The failing operation was a stdin pipe write whose
//!    EPIPE can only mean *the child died first* — proven empirically: a
//!    reaped player child turns the next write into `BrokenPipeError`, and a
//!    SIGTERM-not-yet-reaped child still accepts writes into the 64 KiB pipe
//!    buffer. "device closed" was never established; child death was.
//!
//! 2. **`--fatal-errors` makes aplay abort mid-stream.** The production argv
//!    passed `--fatal-errors`, whose documented behavior is "treat all
//!    errors (e.g. xrun) as fatal … aborts immediately". With per-piece
//!    feeding (first piece ~1.5 s of PCM, successor synthesis gaps of
//!    1.6–2.5 s), a real-device underrun on resume makes aplay EXIT — the
//!    writer's next `write` gets EPIPE. Null-device and fast-sink fixtures
//!    never xrun, which is exactly why every prior automated test passed
//!    while the real device failed. The fix removes `--fatal-errors` so
//!    aplay recovers xruns by its documented default.
//!
//! 3. **A dead-player stream must fail its OWN segment exactly once and
//!    recover on the next turn.** In-segment short-circuiting existed, but
//!    nothing pinned: (a) no further player spawns for the remaining pieces
//!    of a failed segment, (b) the failure settles once (one terminal
//!    outcome), (c) the NEXT turn spawns a fresh player and succeeds, and
//!    (d) an errno-preserving message replaces the invented "(device
//!    closed?)" text.
//!
//! 4. **Appended-stream byte accounting.** `begin_stream` on an
//!    already-open stream reset `written_total` to 0, corrupting the
//!    cumulative `BytesWritten` receipt for the appended pieces. Pinned.
//!
//! The controlled players here consume at a realistic bounded rate
//! (32 000 B/s = 16 kHz s16 mono), with delayed first read, mid-stream
//! death (simulating the aplay abort), early-successful-exit before all
//! bytes arrive, nonzero exit, and write-after-reap. No real audio device
//! is ever opened.
