//! VRO-17 PR-4: the host playback owner.
//!
//! Receives canonical PCM (16 kHz mono s16 LE), owns a **bounded**
//! in-process queue, and drives a user-installed `aplay`-class player
//! over **stdin pipes** (`-t raw -f S16_LE -r 16000 -c 1`): no WAV
//! spooling, no files, no full-turn accumulation, no system-volume
//! changes, no untracked system-service playback. The device is never
//! assumed to accept anything else — the argv names the exact raw
//! format so the player performs any device negotiation.
//!
//! **Receipt semantics (verified, not inferred):**
//!
//! - `BytesWritten(n)` — our bytes handed to the child's stdin pipe.
//!   Strongest fact: *transport*. Proves nothing about device handoff,
//!   audibility, or completion.
//!
//! - `Drained` — the child **exited 0 after stdin EOF**, which for
//!   aplay's write-then-play pipeline is the documented drain point:
//!   aplay plays everything it read before exiting. Strongest fact:
//!   *the player finished consuming and playing our bytes*. It is still
//!   not proof a human heard them.
//!
//! - `Unknown` — used whenever weaker evidence is all we have (device
//!   missing, error before/at handoff, progress not confirmed). Never
//!   upgraded.
//!
//! Process exit for a *nonzero* status is an error, never completion,
//! and writing stdin alone is never completion. Stop/flush kills and
//! reaps exactly our own child (process group), separately from any
//! slow provider/runtime cleanup — but stop-effect timing is not
//! acoustic silence and is never claimed as such.
//!
//! Missing platform/player/device ⇒ truthful `Unavailable` with the
//! setup route; the TUI keeps the textual answer regardless.
// PR-4 repair: this owner is driven by the production
// `ConversationHost::speak_unit` path; no dead-code waiver needed. The
// `NoDevice` variant remains feature-allowed (surfaced by the Settings
// readiness panel when a device is explicitly unconfigured).
