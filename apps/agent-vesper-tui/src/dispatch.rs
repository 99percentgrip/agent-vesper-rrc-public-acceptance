//! Event-loop dispatch — the pure bridge between the command registry, the
//! Plan Mode state machine, the superpower override store, and the transcript.
//!
//! This module owns **no** terminal I/O. The production binary's event loop
//! owns the crossterm input buffer, the raw-mode lifecycle, and the
//! [`ratatui`] frame; it hands each parsed [`CommandIntent`] to [`dispatch`],
//! which mutates a [`SessionState`] in place and reports whether to continue
//! or quit. Keeping the dispatch logic here lets the full Plan Mode lifecycle
//! (`NORMAL → PLANNING → REVIEW → EXECUTING`) be exercised by integration
//! tests under a [`crate::ui::StubRenderer`] without ever touching a terminal.
//!
//! ## Driver/Navigator contract
//!
//! The Plan Mode state machine is pure: it owns *transition discipline*, not
//! reasoning. Under ADR 0010 (Tier C Phase 5) the model drives the
//! `PLANNING → REVIEW` transition by emitting the `update_plan` tool; the
//! agent loop surfaces the rendered plan and [`apply_model_plan`] finalizes
//! it for review. The human-authored `/review <body>` placeholder is retired.
//! Free text typed while a question is pending is routed to
//! [`PlanState::answer`](crate::plan_mode::PlanState::answer) so the driver
//! can refine the plan inline.
